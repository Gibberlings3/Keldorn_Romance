@1    = ~I've been thinking the same thing for years. It never happens.~
@2    = ~I know how painful this must be for you. I'm sorry.~
@3    = ~Dwelling on your problems won't help.~
@4    = ~You're in the prime of your life, Keldorn. You'll find someone else.~
@5    = ~I can't help you.~
@6    = ~No one can.~
@7    = ~How can you know anything of my pain? Maria and I have been married these twenty years, and now...~
@8    = ~I never imagined that anything could hurt this much.~
@9    = ~I can think of little else.~
@10   = ~You mean well, but I have no desire to do so. Maria is... was... the love of my life.~
@11   = ~It is said that time heals all. This may be true, but it moves slowly indeed.~
@12   = ~It doesn't seem that way to me. I always feel like the day isn't long enough to do everything that I've got to do.~
@13   = ~I understand. You want time to pass, but it drags on forever.~
@14   = ~You need to stay busy. Maybe you should take up a hobby.~
@15   = ~I've always found that the best way to forget disappointment is to go out and make new friends.~
@16   = ~You are fortunate.~
@17   = ~I know that my perception is wrong, that the days pass as quickly for me as they do for everyone else, but it does not feel that way.~
@18   = ~Nothing interests me.~
@19   = ~I am poor company, I fear.~
@20   = ~Each day, I rise full of hope, that the nightmare will have ended and things will be as they were before, but nothing has changed.~
@21   = ~I know that feeling. I keep hoping that one day, I'll wake up and everything will be different, too.~
@22   = ~Change will come, Keldorn. Have faith.~
@23   = ~Maybe it would help if you varied your routine. Try sleeping on your other side, or putting your boots on the other side of your bedroll.~
@24   = ~If you took a lover, you would have something more pleasant to think about when you woke up.~
@25   = ~Perhaps one day it will be, but right now, I cannot imagine how.~
@26   = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, faith will be my salvation, as it has always been before.~
@27   = ~I fear that it will take more than a few trivial changes to alter my thoughts.~
@28   = ~I could not, <CHARNAME>. My heart recoils at the thought.~
@29   = ~You mean well, <CHARNAME>, but I fear there is little you can do to help me. My heart lies heavy and I know that grief must run its course.~
@30   = ~The Order has always been my life, but I cannot help but wonder how different things would be now if I had spent more time with my family.~
@31   = ~Tell me about it. I spend all my time doing things that everyone else wants.~
@32   = ~You did what you could, Keldorn. You have a genuine calling, and that is impossible to ignore.~
@33   = ~Saying 'what if' now will only make you miserable. You need to make your life better now, not to dwell on past decisions.~
@34   = ~Your family would be larger, that's for sure. I can't imagine how any woman could resist the temptation of having you around all the time.~
@35   = ~Sacrifice is required of us all, my friend, and the burden can be heavy.~
@36   = ~I know what you mean. I've had to give up plenty.~
@37   = ~Your sacrifice will be rewarded, Keldorn. You've given up everything you love for the sake of duty, and Torm won't forget that.~
@38   = ~Stop thinking about what you've lost. Think about what you've gained instead. You've done much good in the course of your life, and that's something to be proud of.~
@39   = ~I'm willing to undertake the task of cheering you up if you're willing to let me.~
@40   = ~In my heart of hearts, I know that you speak the truth.~
@41   = ~I think of the past because I have given up my hopes for the future.~
@42   = ~Have mercy, <CHARNAME>. I cannot bear to think of what could have been.~
@43   = ~You have, <CHARNAME>, and I pray that when you are tested, you will prove stronger than your taint.~
@44   = ~I have fulfilled my obligations to my god and the Order, but I am not without my share of regrets. There is much I would change, if I knew then what I know now.~
@45   = ~I've never found regret to be all that helpful. I make my decisions and I stick with them.~
@46   = ~Things happen the way they do for a reason, Keldorn. We might not know the reason now, but in time, all will become clear.~
@47   = ~We all make mistakes, Keldorn. The best we can do is try not to make the same ones again.~
@48   = ~You could always make sure that your next lady is more accommodating.~

@50   = ~Do not seek to undertake the impossible, <CHARNAME>.~

@52   = ~We must all abide by the decisions we make... no matter how painful the consequences.~
@53   = ~You are wise beyond your years, <CHARNAME>. I pray that the time may be soon, but I know that I must wait... and try to be patient.~
@54   = ~Under the circumstances, that would be impossible.~
@55   = ~I do not seek to fill the void in my heart with another.~
@56   = ~<CHARNAME>, I owe you an explanation for my behavior of late.~
@57   = ~I'll say! I've been afire with curiosity.~
@58   = ~Friends don't need explanations, Keldorn, but if you think it will help you, I'll gladly listen to whatever you have to say.~
@59   = ~Maybe it will help if you get it off your chest.~
@60   = ~You can tell me anything you want... and I do mean *anything*.~
@61   = ~I'd really rather not hear it, Keldorn. It seems to embarrass you, and I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.~
@62   = ~I've heard far more than I ever wanted to hear, Keldorn. Please don't make me listen to any more.~
@63   = ~Maria and I were married when we were both very young. I was a squire of the Order and she was... everything that a young squire could want.~
@64   = ~(You listen attentively.)~
@65   = ~Can you skip to the part where she kicked you out?~
@66   = ~On second thought, this is personal. I would rather that you did not tell me any more.~
@67   = ~Her family did not approve of the match. They could find no fault with my character... or my behavior towards their daughter. They objected to the prospect of having an itinerant squire paladin as a son-in-law. Maria understood the demands of my calling... or so I thought... and we were married before the summer campaigns.~
@68   = ~I saw her little that first year, though we wrote often. Her letters were full of love and longing, but she seemed content to wait for my return. In the fullness of time, Leona was born, and some years later, Vesper.~
@69   = ~Perhaps I should have sensed the change in her letters. They became less frequent, but I assumed that the demands of motherhood left her little time for correspondence.~
@70   = ~Where once they were full of fond reminiscences and loving anticipation of my next leave, they were now full of tidings about my children and minutae about the day to day affairs of my estate.~
@71   = ~Over the last few years, the letters that sustained me had all but stopped. Every campaign, I would eagerly await the letter-carrier, only to be disappointed, but I never dreamed that anything was amiss. I told myself that Leona and Vesper were growing, and that Maria's household responsibilities had increased. Of course she had no time to write.~
@72   = ~(You let him go on without interruption.)~
@73   = ~Do you still have the letters?~
@74   = ~How does this have any bearing on your separation?~
@75   = ~This is all very personal, Keldorn. I don't want to know any more.~
@76   = ~You know what I found on my latest visit to my family, so I will spare you a recounting of that.~
@77   = ~Through it all, Maria never imagined that I would leave the Order. Once she realized that I planned to do just that, she had much to think about.~
@78   = ~She had learned to love the independence my frequent absence gave her. She raised our daughters and managed our estate with little interference from me, and she found that she did not want to give that up. When it became apparent that I would return, sharing the duties she had come to think of as her own, she resented it deeply.~
@79   = ~At first, she put a brave face on her suffering. She might have even been happy at the thought of a full-time husband and father in the house. Her happiness did not last, however. By the fourth day after our reconciliation, she was ready to demand the dissolution of our marriage.~
@80   = ~I wouldn't have acted like that, if I were in her place.~
@81   = ~Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me that. It must not have been easy for you.~
@82   = ~Does it feel better, getting that off your chest?~
@83   = ~So, does this mean that your marriage is legally annulled?~
@84   = ~Aye, parting with them would be like tearing out a piece of my soul.~
@85   = ~I like to keep old letters, too.~
@86   = ~That's certainly understandable. Go on with your story... if you still want to, that is.~
@87   = ~I'm not sure that it's healthy for you to hang on to them, if they are unpleasant reminders.~
@88   = ~Ooh, what I wouldn't give to read them. The thought of you as a handsome young squire...~
@89   = ~My tale is nearly done.~
@90   = ~We all cling to the past, in one form or another. Let us return to the tale. It is nearly done.~
@91   = ~I could not bear to part with them. Not yet. Let us return to the tale. It is nearly done.~
@92   = ~That would be highly inappropriate, I think. Let us return to the tale. It is nearly done.~
@93   = ~If I did not die of shame in the Order's headquarters while the Rites of Separation were read, I will not perish telling you of it, but if you would rather not speak of it, I will say no more.~
@94   = ~Tell me, then.~
@95   = ~Thanks, but I would still rather not talk about it.~
@96   = ~Very well, I will say no more of it.~
@97   = ~Her behavior is baffling, but her decision is final enough.~
@98   = ~It was difficult, but you have a right to know the outcome of my... my marriage to Lady Maria.~
@99   = ~I did not tell you to ease my conscience. I told you because you have a right to know the outcome of my... my marriage to Lady Maria.~
@100  = ~The Rites of Separation were read in the Order's headquarters the day before I returned to you. Legally, our marriage is no more.~
@101  = ~That makes it easier for you to travel, at least. No more worries about being gone too long.~
@102  = ~Oh, Keldorn, I'm sorry.~
@103  = ~That does sound rather final.~
@104  = ~So... you're a free man, eh?~
@105  = ~Aye... Forgive me. I can speak no more of it.~
@106  = ~Our marriage is dissolved, but while we live, we may yet be reconciled and wed anew. That is my fondest hope.~
@107  = ~Aye, though I wear the chains of my broken dreams.~
@108  = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, but I have said all that I intended to say. We should return to the others.~
@109  = ~The last time we spoke, I laid the blame for the failure of my marriage at Maria's feet. That was unjust.~
@110  = ~I know what you mean. I've blamed other people for my own failures before, and I've regretted it, too.~
@111  = ~You are going through a difficult time. Don't be so hard on yourself.~
@112  = ~It usually isn't as simple as that, Keldorn. Sometimes, things don't work out, and it isn't anybody's fault.~
@113  = ~Why are you still worrying about whose fault it was? The important thing now is that you're free!~
@114  = ~You are young, <CHARNAME>, and such lapses are hardly unforgivable. In a man my age...~
@115  = ~You make excuses for me, but I deserve none.~
@116  = ~That may be so, but in this case, the truth is clear to me.~
@117  = ~Never has 'freedom' been so unwelcome.~
@118  = ~The fault was mine and I was a coward not to own it. I did my duty to Torm and to my Order, but those were not my only obligations. I should have been a better father to my daughters. I should have been a better husband to Maria.~
@119  = ~I failed in my responsibility to them and they have been taken from me.~
@120  = ~Life can be so unfair. I don't know how many times I deserved a second chance, but I never got one.~
@121  = ~You're only human, Keldorn, and you can't be everywhere at once. You were there for your family as much as you could possibly have been.~
@122  = ~Even if it is too late with Maria, you still have your daughters.~
@123  = ~You weren't meeting your responsibilities as a husband, eh? Maybe you need more practice.~
@124  = ~I had many chances to do right by my family, and I failed at all of them.~
@125  = ~You are kind to say that I did my best, but my best fell too far short of the mark.~
@126  = ~My daughters... reside with their mother. They have no desire to be with their father, and why should they?~
@127  = ~I do not pretend to understand what you mean, <CHARNAME>. I have already lost my wife. There is nothing more that can be done.~
@128  = ~The guilt is mine, and mine alone, yet despite the agony it causes me, I feel... relieved that the worst has already happened. That only adds to my remorse.~
@129  = ~And I thought I was confused.~
@130  = ~I understand. You're being unfair to yourself, but there isn't much I can say that would convince you otherwise. All I can do is tell you that I'll be here any time you want to talk.~
@131  = ~You're letting your grief and frustration cloud your judgment, Keldorn. Maybe you should make a list of all the good things you've done. I'm sure it would be longer than you think.~
@132  = ~Perhaps physical *ahem* punishment will bring you relief of a different sort.~
@133  = ~Aye, it is true. My confusion nearly overwhelms me, though I know that I must bear the strain for all our sakes.~
@134  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Your friendship means much to me during this difficult time.~
@135  = ~I know my good qualities as completely as I know my faults. The knowledge brings me little comfort.~
@136  = ~<CHARNAME>... I will pretend I never heard that remark.~
@137  = ~I long to live again, <CHARNAME>, to feel... normal... but I know that it is impossible, and will be for some time. I beg your forbearance, but there is little that I can do to speed the process.~
@138  = ~It galls me to feel so helpless when I know that you have need of my strength. I can only assure you that the power of my faith and the force of my arm are undiminished by whatever torments oppress my heart.~
@139  = ~I am glad, because I do have need of you.~
@140  = ~I have faith, Keldorn. You will heal in time, but do not be uneasy. I value your company always.~
@141  = ~Perhaps concentrating on our quest will make your burden seem lighter as well.~
@142  = ~Your heart would feel better if you filled it with something else... or someone.~
@143  = ~I will not fail you, <CHARNAME>.~
@144  = ~You speak of the impossible.~
@145  = ~Why am I being tested in this way? Have I not proven myself to Torm time and again?~
@146  = ~Trials never end. My life has been nothing but one big test.~
@147  = ~Torm has not abandoned you, my friend. He has given you the strength you need to overcome this.~
@148  = ~Bad things happen to good people, Keldorn. As painful as this is for you, it may be nothing more than bad luck.~
@149  = ~Maybe this is Torm's way of telling you that you're overdoing it. A little fling might be just what you need to get your life back on track.~
@150  = ~I don't know. I don't know if anyone will ever know.~
@151  = ~Alas, you may be right.~
@152  = ~Aye, and it would appear that mine will be, as well.~
@153  = ~I wish that I had your certainty.~
@154  = ~I have a hard time believing that all of this is bad luck.~
@155  = ~It is far more likely that temptation is the obstacle I am meant to overcome.~
@156  = ~Everything happens for a reason. What could this be, if it is not a test of faith?~
@157  = ~Plenty of things have happened to me for no reason whatsoever.~
@158  = ~It may not be as simple as that. We are not meant to understand the will of the gods.~
@159  = ~Perhaps this is meant to bring you closer to Torm.~
@160  = ~Maybe Torm intended you for someone else.~
@161  = ~Or perhaps we merely lack the understanding to fathom the intent.~
@162  = ~Aye, my friend, that has the ring of truth.~
@163  = ~Perhaps...~
@164  = ~I have nothing to give to another. Without my family, I am but a shell of a man, animated only by my faith in Torm.~
@165  = ~It may be that humility is the lesson that I must learn. I presumed too much, and pride has been my downfall.~
@166  = ~There's nothing wrong with being proud of your accomplishments.~
@167  = ~I won't tell you what to think. I can only say that whatever hardships you face, and whatever the reason for them, I'll be here to help you, as you have helped me.~
@168  = ~Don't take this the wrong way, but you might be looking into this too deeply. Take each day as it comes, and everything will sort itself out in the end.~
@169  = ~If you want to learn to be more submissive, I might have a suggestion or two.~
@170  = ~There is a difference between having satisfaction in one's accomplishments and being proud of oneself.~
@171  = ~Thank you. Such steadfast friendship is a comfort in this time of trial.~
@172  = ~I hope that you may be right.~
@173  = ~If you intend what I believe you do, I must ask you to speak no more of such things.~
@174  = ~Whatever the reason for my present misery, I have been given much to think about. My comfort is that whatever Torm intends, it will be for the good of all.~
@175  = ~You retire already?~
@176  = ~I'm tired, so I think I'll turn in.~
@177  = ~We've had a busy day, but I'll stay up if you want company.~
@178  = ~You've been drinking, haven't you? Maybe it would be a good idea for you to turn in, too.~
@179  = ~I was thinking about going to bed, yes. Would you care to join me?~
@180  = ~Sleep well, then.~
@181  = ~Nay, do not let me keep you from your rest.~
@182  = ~I am hardly incapacitated.~
@183  = ~Er... no, you cannot mean that. It would be inappropriate, to say the least.~
@184  = ~I am not yet weary, and the company in the common room is lively enough. I will stay to hear another song or two, perhaps.~
@185  = ~I like music, too. Maybe I'll keep you company.~
@186  = ~It's good to see you taking an interest in pleasant things. Enjoy yourself.~
@187  = ~Are you sure this is wise? You haven't been yourself lately.~
@188  = ~If it's music and companionship you want, I can sing to you in private.~
@189  = ~I thank you for the offer, but I will be fine by myself. I shall not stay up too late.~
@190  = ~Thank you, my friend. I believe that I may.~
@191  = ~I have not, but I have little to fear from an ale and a tune or two.~
@192  = ~<CHARNAME>, no. I am... it would be wrong. Besides, I have been too much alone of late.~
@193  = ~Sleep well, my friend. When morning comes, I will be ready to leave when you are.~
@194  = ~Oh gods, my head...~
@195  = ~You should have let me stay up with you. I would never have allowed you to wind up in such a state.~
@196  = ~Oh, Keldorn, you look like death.~
@197  = ~You are in a sorry state. Let's get some breakfast in you and see if that perks you up.~
@198  = ~Shall I assume that you had a good time?~
@199  = ~I wanted to be alone.~
@200  = ~I feel like death.~
@201  = ~Food would be advisable, I think.~
@202  = ~I think I did. What I remember, anyway.~
@203  = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I overindulged shamefully, but I am fit for duty, or I will be, once I've had something to settle my stomach.~
@204  = ~That was very inconsiderate, Keldorn. I need you alert and focused, not groggy and avoiding loud noises.~
@205  = ~It was bound to happen sooner or later, I suppose. After what that you've been through, one wild night is perfectly understandable.~
@206  = ~Why did you do this to yourself, Keldorn? You're not like this.~
@207  = ~I'm hurt. If you were going to get yourself drunk and act reckless, you could at least have included me in your plans.~
@208  = ~I sincerely apologize.~
@209  = ~You are kind, but my behavior was inexcusable.~
@210  = ~I do not know what came over me. When you retired, my mood was relaxed and my heart was lighter than it has been since Maria ended our marriage. I listened to the minstrels, I exchanged pleasantries with some of the locals, and all was well. And then a change came over me.~
@211  = ~A party of revelers entered, continuing the festivities begun at a wedding earlier that day. The bride and groom danced, the wine flowed freely, and the inn took on a festival air.~
@212  = ~I fell into a reckless, fey humor and I drank far more than I ever have before. The last thing I remember, I was... dancing with one of the wedding guests.~
@213  = ~The pounding in my head and the queasiness of my gut woke me not long before you yourself came down.~
@214  = ~It sounds like I missed out on a good time.~
@215  = ~You did have a rough time of it. Are you sure you're able to travel today?~
@216  = ~At least you got that out of your system.~
@217  = ~Your last memory was dancing, eh? Did you wake up alone?~
@218  = ~My behavior was inexcusable, so I am thankful that you were not there to witness it.~
@219  = ~Saying that I enjoyed myself would be like comparing the lividity of fever to the glow of health. Last night's revelry was but the mockery of mirth.~
@220  = ~Are you sure you are up to traveling today?~
@221  = ~Let's pack up our things and go.~
@222  = ~The ache in my head will fade soon enough once I am set to some righteous task.~
@223  = ~From the sound of things, it sounds like I missed out on a good time.~
@224  = ~You make it sound like you expected such folly from me.~
@225  = ~I expected you to prepare for today's tasks, but what is done is done.~
@226  = ~You aren't the first person to suffer a broken heart, Keldorn. You may do many unexpected things before this has run its course.~
@227  = ~You were ready to explode. You needed to let off some steam.~
@228  = ~I don't know what to expect from you anymore.~
@229  = ~I am a paladin of Torm.~
@230  = ~Paladins have the same needs as other mortals.~
@231  = ~You are also a man who has very recently suffered a painful rejection. If you did seek comfort in the arms of another, it would be understandable.~
@232  = ~It might be good for you if you did.~
@233  = ~Just think of all the desires you must be suppressing...~
@234  = ~Aye, let's go.~
@235  = ~I have made whatever preparations are necessary.~
@236  = ~From the sound of things, it seems like I missed out on a good time.~
@237  = ~Are you sure you're able to travel today?~
@238  = ~Last night was utter lunacy. It will not happen again.~
@239  = ~Whatever madness took me, it is past.~
@240  = ~I do not know, either, but whatever it is, there will be no repeat of yesterday's antics.~
@241  = ~I hope you will forgive me if I decline to answer yea or nay. Suffice it to say that I retired in an inebriated state.~
@242  = ~If it is not inconvenient, I would like to dispatch a letter as soon as possible.~
@243  = ~I have some correspondence that needs to go out as well.~
@244  = ~You have been working on that letter for some time, and with a very anxious expression. Is everything alright?~
@245  = ~I don't mean to pry, but you've written to Maria, haven't you?~
@246  = ~Love letters, Keldorn?~
@247  = ~Ah, good. My request is not an imposition, then.~
@248  = ~Time has passed, and emotions have calmed. I have written to Maria with the hope that my pleas will be well received.~
@249  = ~I'd never stoop to begging.~
@250  = ~Do you have reason to believe that she has had a change of heart?~
@251  = ~It isn't my place to tell you what to do, but I'm not sure that sending that letter is a good idea.~
@252  = ~It's time to break with the past, Keldorn. There are plenty of women who would welcome tender words from you.~
@253  = ~My pride was the source of this tragedy, so perhaps the relinquishing of it will be the remedy.~
@254  = ~If she takes you back, will you leave?~
@255  = ~Are you sure you want to send that letter? If she writes back... There is a big difference between anticipating an unpleasant event and experiencing it.~
@256  = ~The damage is already done, and the wounds have begun to heal. Do you really want to go through that all over again?~
@257  = ~I still think it would be better if you let someone else help you to forget the past.~
@258  = ~I have had no communication from Maria, but I have had no proof that her heart has not softened. Traveling as we do, it would be difficult for her to contact me.~
@259  = ~I cannot rest until I have tried every means within my power to win her back.~
@260  = ~Then perhaps these tender words might serve to win her back.~
@261  = ~Aye, though I would be sorry to leave.~
@262  = ~It may be that hope is lost, but I cannot rest until I know the truth. For good or ill.~
@263  = ~It grows late. Let us retire, and face tomorrow when it comes.~
@264  = ~When a wound heals badly, one has no choice but to tear it open anew to set it to rights.~
@265  = ~I do not wish to forget the past.~
@266  = ~It pains me to think that whatever the results of my letter, Leona will not want to see me again. She despises me, I fear.~
@267  = ~That is hard. I've lost people close to me, too, and it hurts.~
@268  = ~She may come around. Girls her age often rebel against their parents. They can be cruel, but they usually outgrow it eventually.~
@269  = ~Maybe you should write her a letter, too. Her feelings toward you might soften if you told her how much she means to you.~
@270  = ~She may act as if she doesn't like you, but for the rest of her life, she'll be comparing every young man she meets to you. I doubt many will be able to bear the comparison.~
@271  = ~You have, it is true, and in ways far more final than the estrangement of a child. I apologize. I should not burden you with such insignificant regrets when you have endured so much worse.~
@272  = ~It's alright, Keldorn. No one ever really thinks about my feelings, so I should be used to it by now.~
@273  = ~No, don't apologize. Pain is an individual experience, so it's only natural for you to want to talk about what is affecting you.~
@274  = ~I didn't mean to change the subject. Go on.~
@275  = ~I have learned to live with my losses, and you will too.~
@276  = ~It hurts, Keldorn, and it will never get any better. At least you had a chance to say goodbye.~
@277  = ~I'm sorry, but I just can't talk about this anymore.~
@278  = ~I pray that you may be right.~
@279  = ~I will heed your advice, though I fear that she may tear the letter to shreds.~
@280  = ~Young men! <CHARNAME>, she is far too young to think of such things.~
@281  = ~I wasn't much older than her the first time I kissed a boy.~
@282  = ~She's young now, but you will always be her father, and she will always remember you.~
@283  = ~How old was Maria when you first pressed your suit?~
@284  = ~She may start showing an interest just to spite you.~
@285  = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, I have been insensitive to the difficulties you face. Let us return to your quest so that my actions may lessen them somewhat.~
@286  = ~I worry that her hostility toward me will prevent her from seeking reconciliation later.~
@287  = ~There is nothing more to say... though perhaps there is a question you may be able to answer.~
@288  = ~I do not want to learn to live with it. I want to mend the breach... if only I knew how.~
@289  = ~Would that I did have the chance. Maria sent my daughters away before my arrival and I was forced to depart before their return. As for the rest...~
@290  = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry to have caused you such pain.~
@291  = ~Death is ever our companion. Should I fall, I wonder if she would feel the same.~
@292  = ~Indeed! She is so young, and already a firebrand! I pray that her heart softens toward me soon.~
@293  = ~I pray that you are right.~
@294  = ~Your words comfort me. All fathers want to see their daughters grow up to be capable, independent women... regardless of any rift which might separate them.~
@295  = ~Ha! You do know how to banish a father's peace of mind. Come, let us return to your quest before my anxiety renders me speechless.~
@296  = ~Your words bring me comfort.~
@297  = ~Maria was older than Leona, that is certain... though perhaps not old enough that my suit was agreeable to her father.~
@298  = ~That is my fear as well.~
@299  = ~Forgive me for inquiring about so personal a matter, but did you ever feel such resentment toward your foster-father?~
@300  = ~I still do, in a way. He died suddenly, and I can't help feeling a sense of abandonment.~
@301  = ~No, I was a rather shy, obedient child, but Leona has a different temperament than I did at her age.~
@302  = ~A little, yes, but after Gorion was no longer part of my life, I began to miss him. I'm sure Leona will feel the same.~
@303  = ~Did I ever! If you only knew how hard a time I gave him.~
@304  = ~There is much of Maria in Leona. She too was a passionate young woman, before my absence drove her to despair.~
@305  = ~At the time, I paid it little heed, but now I begin to wonder if her father's objections did not encourage our amour more than hinder it. Resentment can provide powerful motivation.~
@306  = ~Vesper is growing up so fast, I wonder if I will even recognize her, should I ever see her again.~
@307  = ~How much could she change? I may be an adult now, but I still look much like I did when I was a child.~
@308  = ~Have faith, Keldorn. Maria will not want to deprive your children of their father forever.~
@309  = ~If you appealed to the Order, they might help you arrange visits with your children, once things are more settled.~
@310  = ~This obsession with your family is not healthy, Keldorn.~
@311  = ~Leona is not that much older than Vesper, and she has changed much.~
@312  = ~It would be ironic if you met her and didn't recognize her.~
@313  = ~Leona is becoming a woman, so there are bound to be a few changes, but I'm sure her face isn't that different.~
@314  = ~You'll see them both again soon. Maria will relent eventually.~
@315  = ~Have you considered the possibility that your obsession with your family might not be healthy?~
@316  = ~I don't know, <CHARNAME>, I just don't know.~
@317  = ~Maria has custody of the girls until they reach the age of maturity. Even with the Order's assistance, I would still need Maria's permission to visit my daughters.~
@318  = ~Failure is difficult to accept.~
@319  = ~Aye, and I fear that it is likely.~
@320  = ~I... I do not remember.~
@321  = ~I have failed, <CHARNAME>. Failed as a husband, failed as a father. When my daughters were born, I was deployed with the Order. I never heard their first words, I never saw their first steps. When Vesper saw me for the first time, she was old enough to ask 'Who's that?'~
@322  = ~Is it any wonder that Maria should withhold my daughters from me now? I was never a part of their lives before.~
@323  = ~I don't know what to say.~
@324  = ~You have never seen Torm, but you know that he exists. You have never met, yet you love him and he is still a part of your life.~
@325  = ~Give it time, Keldorn. When your life is more stable, you can explain everything. I'm sure that Maria will not refuse you.~
@326  = ~It may have worked out for the best. You are better off not saddled with a wife and family.~
@327  = ~There is nothing to say. I should not have burdened you with my troubles.~
@328  = ~I like helping people, if I can.~
@329  = ~Listening to you is never a bother, Keldorn. I only wish I could help.~
@330  = ~It's all part of the job.~
@331  = ~(sigh) Let's get back to what we were doing before, alright?~
@332  = ~Blasphemy, <CHARNAME>. Torm is my god, not my father.~
@333  = ~I hope that you may be right, but my heart lies heavy.~
@334  = ~I cannot dismiss them so easily.~
@335  = ~You intend to cheer me with your kind words, but I fear that I am beyond all help.~
@336  = ~I am grateful.~
@337  = ~By listening, you are helping me more than you know.~
@338  = ~Some leaders place little value on the contentment of their followers. I am grateful that you are not one of them.~
@339  = ~Aye, I have wasted much of your time already.~
@340  = ~Many years ago, the summer before Vesper was born, Maria convinced me to take our family on holiday to Esmeltaran. I still remember her joy when I gave in at last.~
@341  = ~I've never been there. Is it nice?~
@342  = ~You were born there, were you not?~
@343  = ~At least you have one pleasant family memory to cheer you.~
@344  = ~There's nothing like sun and sand to fan the flame of romance.~
@345  = ~Reminisce on your own time, Keldorn. I don't feel like listening to it.~
@346  = ~I shall not trouble you with such petty matters again.~
@347  = ~Aye, though I had little leisure to enjoy it.~
@348  = ~Aye, though I left Esmeltaran for Athkatla when I heard my calling. I was but a lad at the time, so many of its attractions held little appeal for me, and I had little time to enjoy them when I returned with my family.~
@349  = ~I wish that were so, but it was not to be.~
@350  = ~Perhaps, but it was not meant to be.~
@351  = ~I was recalled by the Order the very day after our arrival. Trouble was brewing to the south, and the prelate rescinded the leave of every knight, squire, or man-at-arms not already deployed.~
@352  = ~I would have lingered a day or two, at least.~
@353  = ~You must have been disappointed.~
@354  = ~How did Maria take it?~
@355  = ~What a pity. You would have benefited from a summer of leisure and recreation, I'm sure.~
@356  = ~My unit was mustering. I had no choice.~
@357  = ~In truth, I was relieved, though it shames me to admit it now.~
@358  = ~She took it as she always did, with resignation. She kissed me goodbye and never uttered a word of reproach. We had let the house for the whole summer, so Maria and Leona remained behind while I returned to Athkatla.~
@359  = ~Esmeltaran is a resort city, with nothing to do but gamble or while away the evenings with endless social obligations. Maria was in her glory, but there was nothing of interest to me there... nothing except Maria.~
@360  = ~Gods, how I wish that I had memories of that to sustain me now. What I wouldn't give for the chance to walk those white sand beaches with her, or to preside over a soirée with her on my arm...~
@361  = ~Perhaps I shall return there one day, if only to see those beaches and those salons and imagine her beside me.~
@362  = ~It sounds like paradise. I would like to go there myself someday.~
@363  = ~If you feel that it would give you closure... though I'm afraid that it would only increase your pain.~
@364  = ~Perhaps you should go somewhere else instead. It is possible to spend too much time in the company of ghosts.~
@365  = ~I would like to see that myself. Would you take me with you, if you go?~
@366  = ~Perhaps when your quest is done, you will have your chance.~
@367  = ~But... No, my friend, you are right.~
@368  = ~No, it would not be right.~
@369  = ~Those days are lost to me now, and nothing can bring them back. At least I have one treasured memory of the place. I have Vesper... though the gods alone know when I will see her again.~
@370  = ~I should never have sent that letter.~
@371  = ~Who did you write to?~
@372  = ~It was something that you needed to do at the time.~
@373  = ~I questioned the advisability of it myself, but you insisted.~
@374  = ~Why? Is there a new mistress of your heart?~
@375  = ~Maria... You were there when I wrote it.~
@376  = ~Aye, though doing so may have been unwise.~
@377  = ~Aye, and I should have listened to your advice.~
@378  = ~Nay, though perhaps it is time for me to let go of the old one.~
@379  = ~I have waited anxiously for a reply, but I know now that none will ever come. She has made her choice and I must accept it. She has moved on, and perhaps it is time that I did the same.~
@380  = ~I'm proud of you, Keldorn. That was a painful thing for you to have to accept, but you have done so with grace.~
@381  = ~You had to try, for your own peace of mind, if nothing else. There's no reason to regret it.~
@382  = ~Did you have some kind of revelation? What changed your mind?~
@383  = ~Ah, I see the temptation of the single life is starting to appeal to you.~
@384  = ~It's about time.~
@385  = ~You would not say that if you knew the contents of that letter.~
@386  = ~It is not so much the letter itself that I regret, but the sentiments I expressed.~
@387  = ~It was reflecting on the summer I should have spent in Esmeltaran, as much as anything else. One can never cross the same river twice. My letter to her would have made that clear enough.~
@388  = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>, I am not made for such a life.~
@389  = ~In the letter I wrote, I abandoned any pretense of dignity and pleaded shamefully that she would take me back. How could she respond to such a letter? Rejection would have invited even greater humiliation and acceptance would have been unthinkable.~
@390  = ~I now know that reconciliation is impossible. Could I live with myself, knowing that she took me back only because I begged? She knows that I will never truly leave the Order. Even if I retire, if they called me, I would go. Any reunion between us would be temporary at best.~
@391  = ~No, it is better that she live her life the way she wants to live it, and I will do the same. I only regret that our last communication was so... pathetic.~
@392  = ~You could write another letter to her and tell her about your decision.~
@393  = ~We all say foolish things when we are in pain. I'm sure she understands.~
@394  = ~Do you think that she will take up with Sir William again?~
@395  = ~So... any thoughts as to who will be the next Lady Firecam?~
@396  = ~Nay, she would only think that I changed my tactics. Let my silence be her answer, as hers has been mine.~
@397  = ~Aye, she probably does.~
@398  = ~I...do not know. If control over her life was so important to her that she would end our marriage, I cannot see her surrendering it to another man.~
@399  = ~Perhaps the day will come when she does take another lover, but... Nay, I am not yet ready to think about that.~
@400  = ~(chuckles) I am far from ready to begin auditions for that role, if I ever will be.~
@401  = ~This decision has not been easy, my friend, and I am weary from thinking too much. Let us find some wrong that needs righting and think no more of weighty matters.~
@402  = ~Perhaps it is.~
@403  = ~You changed your hair!~
@404  = ~You noticed! Do you like it?~
@405  = ~No, I've been wearing it like this since we met.~
@406  = ~I changed it ages ago. Where have you been?~
@407  = ~Do you like it when I wear it down, flowing around my shoulders?~
@408  = ~Aye, it suits you.~
@409  = ~Does it make me look beautiful?~
@410  = ~You're just saying that.~
@411  = ~Keldorn, I haven't changed a thing.~
@412  = ~I think everyone needs a new look, sometimes. Would you like to try something different for yourself?~
@413  = ~Is that a new cloak?~
@414  = ~Yes, it is. Does it bring out the color of my eyes?~
@415  = ~No, it's the same one I've always had.~
@416  = ~It's fairly new, but I've been wearing it for weeks. You haven't been paying attention.~
@417  = ~I don't wear it often, but when I do, I like to pull it back away from my decolletage. What do you think?~
@418  = ~I have been rather distracted of late.~
@419  = ~And you don't feel distracted now?~
@420  = ~I wasn't going to say anything, but I suspected that might be the case when I watched you pour tea in your porridge and eat it.~
@421  = ~It's good to see you finally coming around.~
@422  = ~And here I thought my stunning good looks were unsettling you.~
@423  = ~Ahem. I imagine the young men are most appreciative.~
@424  = ~I do like attention from time to time.~
@425  = ~I'm not too worried about what the young men think. It makes me feel attractive, and that's what matters.~
@426  = ~I wouldn't mind hearing what some not-so-young men think, Keldorn.~
@427  = ~To a man my age, all young ladies are distressingly fair.~
@428  = ~I am a paladin. I am not in the habit of employing deceit.~
@429  = ~It's just that you've never complimented me about anything before.~
@430  = ~Nice try, but I've heard you lie.~
@431  = ~So, is there anything else about me that you find appealing?~
@432  = ~It's good to see you noticing the world around you again.~
@433  = ~I yield. You've found me out.~
@434  = ~So, is there anything about me that you like?~
@435  = ~Why the sudden interest in my appearance?~
@436  = ~You don't have to flatter me, Keldorn.~
@437  = ~I was starting to wonder if anything was going to get through that shell of yours.~
@438  = ~I would not know where to begin.~
@439  = ~Teehee! Neither would I!~
@440  = ~You would look younger if you shaved your beard.~
@441  = ~A more tailored wardrobe might help. You have a fine physique beneath all that gear.~
@442  = ~It's a pity we can't do anything about your scars.~
@443  = ~I have found that a successful look always begins with a smile. You should wear one more often.~
@444  = ~New boots, perhaps?~
@445  = ~They are new, yes. They don't look too clunky, do they?~
@446  = ~No, they're the same ones I've always had.~
@447  = ~They're fairly new, but I've been wearing them for weeks. That shows you how much attention men pay to shoes.~
@448  = ~What do you think of them when I bring my knee forward like this?~
@449  = ~Nay, my mind is clear.~
@450  = ~I never noticed.~
@451  = ~I feel as if I've come out of a fog, or awakened from a dream. I hear the birds and see the color of the sky. The air smells fresh and food has taste again.~
@452  = ~It must have been horrible feeling so isolated.~
@453  = ~You sound like you're feeling better. I'm glad.~
@454  = ~I don't know why you're making such a fuss. You've been a little down, but it's passed.~
@455  = ~Does this mean that I've heard the last of your moaning?~
@456  = ~You could have paraded naked in front of me and I never would have known it.~
@457  = ~And well you should! I should have been more observant.~
@458  = ~Indeed, you are wise to dress to please yourself. Attaching too much importance to outward appearances so often leads to disappointment... not that I would notice much.~
@459  = ~Though I have been blind enough to beauty, it seems.~
@460  = ~I do not seek to deceive. I only seek to remedy the lack of attention I have shown.~
@461  = ~I find that it is a strange place.~
@462  = ~Then it would be best if it were not attempted.~
@463  = ~Ask what you will of me, but the beard stays.~
@464  = ~Ahem. Your compliments are enough to make an old man blush.~
@465  = ~I do not fret over reminders of the battles won in the fight against evil.~
@466  = ~Indeed, and perhaps you shall see more of it.~
@467  = ~Aye, they suit you.~
@468  = ~Do they make me look beautiful?~
@469  = ~Something is different... Nay, perhaps it is me.~
@470  = ~I did not know what to feel.~
@471  = ~I do not know if I will ever be the man I was... before. Some wounds never truly heal. I do know that I live, and that is enough.~
@472  = ~Aye, I shall trouble you with my lamentations no more.~
@473  = ~There is something new in the very air I breathe.~
@474  = ~We have been traveling together for some time and you know more of my past than many I have known for years, yet I know almost nothing of you. Indulge an old man and tell me something of your childhood.~
@475  = ~There's so much to tell! Where do you want me to start?~
@476  = ~Well, you know that I grew up in Candlekeep.~
@477  = ~I didn't have a very exciting childhood, I'm afraid. There weren't a lot of other children around.~
@478  = ~I was a bit of a troublemaker, to tell you the truth.~
@479  = ~I hardly remember it. It seems so long ago, almost like it happened to someone else.~
@480  = ~Would you be offended if I didn't want to talk about it?~
@481  = ~Why don't you tell me about your lessons. What was your favorite subject?~
@482  = ~I liked geography best. The monks would take out these enormous maps and talk about far away places. To a child in a monastery, it was rather exciting.~
@483  = ~History always fascinated me. Some of the tales of legendary kings or ancient battles were so vivid, I could almost imagine that I was there.~
@484  = ~It may sound strange, but I was drawn to mathematics. It was like learning a new language, with symbols and numerals forming elegant explanations of the world around me.~
@485  = ~The natural sciences held a strong appeal for me. I loved learning about how everything worked.~
@486  = ~Literature was my favorite. The tales and poems would weave their spell around me, and my imagination would take wing.~
@487  = ~I always preferred the arts. The monks encouraged creative endeavors as well as scholastic ones.~
@488  = ~My favorite lessons were not those conducted in the library. I trained in the practice yard with great zeal.~
@489  = ~I was more interested in teasing the monks, to be honest with you. No matter what the subject was, I would pretend to be daydreaming, answering question after question incorrectly, until the monks were fit to burst. Then, I would summarize the lesson flawlessly. That made them so angry!~
@490  = ~I did not much care for schoolwork, I'm afraid.~
@491  = ~Aye, I believe I heard mention of that. Would you tell me what it was like? I have never been there myself.~
@492  = ~It is a large monastery-fortress atop a cliff overlooking the Sea of Swords. No matter where you go, you hear the cry of the gulls and the crash of the waves against the rocks. And everything smells of salt and old books.~
@493  = ~It is quite the place to visit, if you like books... and if you can get in. Only scholars are admitted, or those making a donation to the library.~
@494  = ~It wasn't anything like Athkatla. Everyone knew one another... and if you put one toe out of line, everyone knew about it.~
@495  = ~It was the dullest place I've ever been. Nowhere to go, nothing to do. And anytime you set foot outside, you all but trip over a gaggle of chanters, endlessly reciting the Prophecies.~
@496  = ~To this day, I have no idea why Candlekeep continues to exist. The laws of economics don't seem to apply there, since most of the people there seem more intent on study than on earning a living.~
@497  = ~You aren't missing anything. It's so boring, there isn't even anything to talk about.~
@498  = ~You had Imoen, of course, and there must have been some other children around. Even if the monks and scholars had no families, the craftsmen, shopkeepers, and servants would have had them.~
@499  = ~The only child I was allowed to play with was Imoen. Gorion discouraged me from making many friends.~
@500  = ~Oh, there were a few others. I just didn't make friends easily.~
@501  = ~I never really needed many people around me. I was happier with one good friend than I would have been with a herd of other playmates.~
@502  = ~It is strange, now that you mention it. Not a single person in Candlekeep was even married. Well, there were rumors about Phlydia and Firebead, but nothing was ever proven.~
@503  = ~Imoen and I made up for the lack of other playmates by causing four times as much trouble as any other pair of children in Faerun.~
@504  = ~It makes me feel lonely even thinking about it.~
@505  = ~You? I find that difficult to believe.~
@506  = ~Believe it or not, it's true. I was quite the scamp.~
@507  = ~The last few years of my life have had a sobering effect on me.~
@508  = ~All children cause trouble. It's part of the contract.~
@509  = ~There are many kinds of mischief, Keldorn, and some of it is quite enjoyable. Would you care for a demonstration?~
@510  = ~I wouldn't say that I was naughty, exactly. I just had high spirits.~
@511  = ~You're right, I'm lying. I was well-behaved and docile, but it doesn't make for a good story.~
@512  = ~There isn't really much to talk about.~
@513  = ~Now that I can well believe.~
@514  = ~I was quite the scamp alright.~
@515  = ~The last few years of my life have had a sobering effect on me. You should have seen me then.~
@516  = ~Actually, I'm lying. I was well-behaved and docile, but it doesn't make for a good story.~
@517  = ~Aye, I do not doubt you. Your life has been so tumultuous that I am sometimes surprised that you remember whose turn it is to keep watch.~
@518  = ~I keep notes. It helps.~
@519  = ~I don't. That's what I've got you for. You never leave our camp unattended.~
@520  = ~The recent past, I remember only too clearly. My life changed forever that night I left Candlekeep.~
@521  = ~I've blocked most of the memories out. They're still too painful.~
@522  = ~Let's talk about something else.~
@523  = ~Not at all. I have no wish to pry.~
@524  = ~Ah, yes, the unquenchable thirst for adventure and the desire to see what lies beyond the next rise. Some people are not made to live in the same place all their lives.~
@525  = ~So, you are a true scholar, then. You are a rare creature, in this day and age, but the knowledge you possess must serve you in good stead.~
@526  = ~That is an interesting parallel. It is said that those who excel at mathematics also have a talent for strategy. If so, it would certainly explain our survival to date.~
@527  = ~Then you are a leap ahead of the rest of us, who must fumble for words to explain why you find pearls inside oysters, or why eggs get hard when you boil them but potatoes get soft.~
@528  = ~Aye, not everyone is meant for books and tomes, and your training has served you well.~
@529  = ~My, you were a naughty child, even if you were a clever one. How they must have fumed!~
@530  = ~The poetic turn of your speech makes that fact apparent. Still, it is a pleasure to travel in the company of a well-read woman.~
@531  = ~Is there anything else you would like to share with me?~
@532  = ~I could tell you about my studies.~
@533  = ~That's all there is to say.~
@534  = ~It sounds picturesque, if remote. It seems strange to think of Faerun's preeminent seat of scholarly achievement in such a dramatic setting, but the pounding surf does inspire reflection.~
@535  = ~It seems a pity to restrict access to the treasures of Candlekeep to so few, though I do understand the need for security.~
@536  = ~Aye, that is a fact of life in small towns everywhere.~
@537  = ~I can see why such a place would have more appeal to the aged than to the young.~
@538  = ~Candlekeep is funded by private endowments, I would expect. It is not uncommon for wealthy individuals to become patrons of scholars or artists.~
@539  = ~That is unfortunate, but it is understandable, if he knew your heritage. I can understand why he might wish to limit your exposure to other children.~
@540  = ~That surprises me. You are an open and caring individual. One would think you might make friends easily.~
@541  = ~You place a high value on friendship, then. I am honored that you have taken me into your confidence.~
@542  = ~Ha! You would be surprised what goes on behind closed doors... or perhaps you would not. Ahem.~
@543  = ~(chuckles) You must have made your tutors old before their time.~
@544  = ~I suppose it is the province of children to give their elders gray hair.~
@545  = ~(sigh) Aye, I can well imagine how your recent past has given you a new perspective.~
@546  = ~Aye, don't I know that well enough.~
@547  = ~Ahem. Some other time, perhaps.~
@548  = ~There is certainly nothing wrong with that.~
@549  = ~That would depend on your point of view. Some might find docile, well-behaved children quite the novelty.~
@550  = ~Aye, I imagine that it would.~
@551  = ~You may rely on me to continue to serve in that capacity. You have many other cares.~
@552  = ~That it did. It is a pity that you did not get to enjoy your childhood a little longer.~
@553  = ~Forgive me, my friend. I did not wish to stir unpleasant memories.~
@554  = ~Thank you for sharing your memories with me. I have enjoyed our conversation.~
@555  = ~I am pleased to see that your education went beyond traditional scholarship. Creative pursuits encourage the imagination and improve perception.~
@556  = ~Another day brings us closer to our goal. Have you given any thought to what you will do once you have accomplished it?~
@557  = ~I've still got a Playhouse to run.~
@558  = ~I can always make myself useful to my Temple.~
@559  = ~I will always have my place in the Grove.~
@560  = ~I have a Keep to manage.~
@561  = ~I find teaching agreeable, so I may decide to take more apprentices.~
@562  = ~Like yourself, I will always be bound to the Order.~
@563  = ~I'm a Ranger Protector. Imnesvale will need me for many years to come.~
@564  = ~I am the leader of a guild...~
@565  = ~I don't know if I'll ever be able to give up adventuring. It's in my blood.~
@566  = ~I thought that I might settle down and raise a family.~
@567  = ~This may sound strange, but I miss Candlekeep. I may see if I can return and pursue a life of study.~
@568  = ~With so many in need of aid, I thought that I might devote my life to charitable works.~
@569  = ~I have power, Keldorn, and I have ambition. I'm sure that I will be able to find some use for both.~
@570  = ~I'll have to decide that when the time comes.~
@571  = ~There are days when I doubt we'll live long enough to find out.~
@572  = ~Aye, you do. It is good that you have such an agreeable prospect waiting for you on your retirement from adventuring.~
@573  = ~Aye, and after all you have experienced, you will be an even more valuable asset to them.~
@574  = ~Aye, and the work you do there is important. As long as people treat Nature with contempt, Nature will always need a guardian.~
@575  = ~Aye, you have people that depend on you for their security and their livelihood. You are responsible for them.~
@576  = ~There is great satisfaction to be had from training the young.~
@577  = ~Aye, membership in our Order comes with responsibilities as well as rewards.~
@578  = ~Aye, wherever people depend on the land for their livelihood, land and people both will need protection.~
@579  = ~Your guild of thieves. Would nothing persuade you to give that up?~
@580  = ~I find it distasteful, but if I do not lead them, someone else will step to the fore, and that person may not be as ethical as I am.~
@581  = ~It isn't so bad. I keep my subordinates from doing too much harm and they make me wealthy. Gold is not inherently evil.~
@582  = ~The guild prevents unauthorized thieves from operating in Athkatla. Without it, crime would be even more rampant than it is now.~
@583  = ~Surely you do not oppose of protecting the interests of others! For a reasonable fee, my guild ensures that no honest merchant need ever fear burglary.~
@584  = ~I am a thief, Keldorn. Nothing will change that.~
@585  = ~Aye, your tale is a familiar one. For some, part of the very soul craves novelty and excitement, and routine becomes abhorrent.~
@586  = ~There is much satisfaction to be had from raising a family.~
@587  = ~The pursuit of enlightenment is never an idle one.~
@588  = ~I cannot think of a worthier cause.~
@589  = ~I do not like the sound of that.~
@590  = ~Power and ambition can be put to beneficial uses as well as selfish ones.~
@591  = ~There is no denying what I am, Keldorn.~
@592  = ~I need a good man to keep me on the path of righteousness. Without one, bad things can happen.~
@593  = ~Ha! I really had you going! Don't worry, Keldorn. It's too soon to know how this will all turn out, but no matter what happens, I won't give in to the taint.~
@594  = ~Perhaps it is rather soon to plan for the future. Your quest should be our immediate concern, and I will aid you in all that is righteous.~
@595  = ~I'm doing rather well, though, don't you think?~
@596  = ~We'll get through this, Keldorn. Together, we can do anything.~
@597  = ~I'm glad to have your help. Gods know that I need it.~
@598  = ~I think I'm having a righteous need at this very moment.~
@599  = ~We have overcome many obstacles already. We can survive and emerge victorious. I will lend my aid in all that is righteous.~
@600  = ~I am doing rather well, now that I think about it.~
@601  = ~It is important to have a goal to strive toward. At the moment, however, your quest should be our immediate concern. Know that I will aid you in all that is righteous.~
@602  = ~Damage control is hardly a cause worthy of your abilities. You should strive to eradicate evil, not to mitigate it.~
@603  = ~One day, I hope to do just that, but you'll never reap barley unless you first plant the seed.~
@604  = ~If there were no evil left in Faerun, what would become of you?~
@605  = ~There's nothing wrong with ending the day with more gold than you had at the start of it.~
@606  = ~My goals might not be as lofty as you want them to be, but they all seem hopelessly out of reach at the moment.~
@607  = ~No, it is a tool that can be used for good or ill. Amassing more will serve no purpose until you decide on a use for it.~
@608  = ~I intend to put whatever wealth I accumulate to noble purposes, but you'll never reap barley unless you first plant the seed.~
@609  = ~I don't know, Keldorn. I'm going to need a lot more of it before I can make up my mind.~
@610  = ~That is extortion, not protection! Do not seek to beguile me with euphemism. Rotten wood is not made whole by a fresh coat of paint.~
@611  = ~You take pride in your profession, then.~
@612  = ~Aye, my friend, that is true enough, though one must always be wary, lest pride and greed erode the foundation of good intent.~
@613  = ~You delight in your heritage, then.~
@614  = ~One pillar may prop up another, but it is better if both are sound. Seek to be strong in yourself, rather than relying on your allies to steady you.~
@615  = ~Ah, you take delight in vexing me!~
@616  = ~No mortal is perfect, my friend, and there is always room for improvement.~
@617  = ~I approve heartily of your zeal.~
@618  = ~You shall have it whenever you need it.~
@619  = ~How may I be of service?~
@620  = ~I need encouragement rather badly.~
@621  = ~I need to do something. I have been standing still too long.~
@622  = ~I'm tired, Keldorn. I need a rest.~
@623  = ~Loosen your armor and step aside with me. I would rather tell you in private.~
@624  = ~Aye, and this crop has a great need of manure to take root, it would seem.~
@625  = ~There are other lands, my friend, and other evils to conquer. As long as this old warrior lives, he shall find employment.~
@626  = ~It is as I feared. You are wholly motivated by greed.~
@627  = ~I thought I had found a friend in you, but I am deceived. Speak to me no more. I wish to be alone with my thoughts.~
@628  = ~Let us return to your quest, and bring you one step closer toward your goals.~
@629  = ~You emerged from a pit of imprisonment, torture and despair to overcome every obstacle in your path. You have defeated foe and fiend alike and stand radiant before me. Yet if you need any encouragement beyond the recounting of your own deeds, I say this. We WILL succeed. We are unstoppable.~
@630  = ~Pause and regain your strength, but do not stop. Never stop.~
@631  = ~<CHARNAME>... even if I were ready for the kind of attention your tone suggests, I am old enough to be your father. Have mercy on an old man.~
@632  = ~Let us return to your quest before either of us says something we'll regret.~
@633  = ~How strange it is, to be thinking of the future in terms of what it holds for me, rather than what lies in store for another.~
@634  = ~That doesn't sound very paladin-like.~
@635  = ~That's true. Even when you traveled with the Order, I imagine that Maria was never far from your thoughts.~
@636  = ~The freedom must be liberating, but don't think that something is unimportant just because it benefits only yourself.~
@637  = ~I thought we were past this. Why are you bringing it up again?~
@638  = ~I never said that I would cease my service to the Order. It became my life long ago, and its goals are my own.~
@639  = ~Every march I led, every decision I made, all were haunted by my concern for how my actions would affect my wife and family. I did my duty in the service of the Order and for the good of the people it protects, and I never regretted doing so, but my heart was ever in Athkatla. Now...~
@640  = ~You do think of my wellbeing every once in a while, I hope.~
@641  = ~Now you are free to decide your own fate.~
@642  = ~You have provided for your family, I hope.~
@643  = ~Where does your heart lie now?~
@644  = ~So I am beginning to discover.~
@645  = ~The knowledge that I served two masters troubled me since I was first married.~
@646  = ~Your cause is important, to myself and all those who might suffer if the danger we face is left unchecked.~
@647  = ~Maria and the children are provided for. My estate would always have gone to my children after my death, but Maria has custody of it now, and with my blessing. I have no need of it.~
@648  = ~My heart is my own.~
@649  = ~For the first time since I was married, there is no need to live up to another's expectations. My heart is no longer divided between serving my god and serving my wife. I am free. It is a terrifying prospect.~
@650  = ~When Gorion died and I found myself on my own, it was scary, but I managed.~
@651  = ~Change is always frightening, but you will adapt.~
@652  = ~Why are you so anxious? You have faced death countless times without fear.~
@653  = ~What do you know? I might actually have more experience at something than you. I've been on my own for a while, now.~
@654  = ~You did more than manage, you thrived. I shall endeavor to do the same.~
@655  = ~I will, as you have already done. You have not only met this challenge but thrived in spite of it. It is still very new to me, but I will adjust.~
@656  = ~Aye, but this is something new.~
@657  = ~Aye, and you have thrived in spite of challenges that might have overwhelmed you. This is new to me, but I will adjust.~
@658  = ~I have faced death on the battlefield and it holds no terror for me, but now I face life. Let us resume your quest, and put this gift to good use.~
@659  = ~Some time ago, I wondered aloud if Torm was testing me. I have come to the realization that he was.~
@660  = ~If he was, he was testing all of us. It has not been easy, holding this group together with your mind so distracted.~
@661  = ~You have been tested before, Keldorn. This cannot be the first test of faith you have endured.~
@662  = ~If it helps you accept what has happened to you, it is as good an explanation as any.~
@663  = ~Do you think he wanted to test your resolve when faced with distraction of a very... *ahem*... personal nature?~
@664  = ~Perhaps. That is as much a test of resolve as anything else.~
@665  = ~Hardly, and it won't be the last.~
@666  = ~One's faith is a personal thing, but in this case, I believe the test to have been real, not the product of a tortured mind.~
@667  = ~I have been tempted with carnal pleasure before and have never yielded.~
@668  = ~My faith, and my courage, have been tested before. I have been faced with hard choices on the battlefield and elsewhere and found strength in Torm. I have lost brothers in arms to their wounds, in the most horrible ways imaginable, and my faith has never faltered.~
@669  = ~But this trial was something new. It touched me where I least expected it, in the home of my heart. I may have been bloodied in the battle, but my faith in Torm never wavered.~
@670  = ~How do you know this was even about you?~
@671  = ~If this has been a battle for you, it has left scars. I wonder if the wounds will ever truly heal.~
@672  = ~I'm glad that you've finally come to terms with the recent events. You seem to be holding up well.~
@673  = ~Torm is a jealous god, if he won't share you with a mortal lover.~
@674  = ~I do not *know* anything, but I believe, nevertheless.~
@675  = ~All wounds heal in time, my friend. Some leave scars, but they become a part of who we are, like the shape of our hands or the color of our eyes.~
@676  = ~As well as can be expected.~
@677  = ~Torm cares nothing for the loves of this world, but he does demand obedience.~
@678  = ~I have been given this second chance to prove myself to Torm, and I am glad of it. Perhaps one must lose everything to find out what really matters. I have my faith, and it is enough.~
@679  = ~I must beg your forgiveness, my friend. I have tried both your patience and our friendship with my personal turmoil, and I sincerely apologize.~
@680  = ~I didn't want to say anything, but you were pushing it on several occasions.~
@681  = ~No, Keldorn, don't apologize. We're friends. What troubles you troubles me, and your burdens are mine.~
@682  = ~The important thing is that you're feeling better now. Let's just move on and forget the past.~
@683  = ~You've been putting me through it, alright.~
@684  = ~I know, but discussing my troubles with you has helped me to overcome them, and I am grateful to you for allowing me to speak freely.~
@685  = ~Your kindness and boundless patience are a credit to you, but I know that my behavior has been unacceptable.~
@686  = ~It will be impossible to forget the past, but I am as eager as you are to put it behind us.~
@687  = ~I seek closure in this, and that means apologizing to the person I have wronged most grievously. Since that terrible day, I have been both selfish and self-absorbed. Forgive me.~
@688  = ~I understand that you need to do this, so I accept your apology freely, but I want you to know that I have never minded talking with you. It's what friends do.~
@689  = ~I forgive you.~
@690  = ~Let's just get back to what we were doing.~
@691  = ~Your friendship has meant much to me.~
@692  = ~Your friendship has been one of the most valuable of my life. Thank you.~
@693  = ~Very well.~
@694  = ~The light here is kind to you, my friend.~
@695  = ~Are you telling me that I look better when it's too dark to see?~
@696  = ~Unexpected compliments are always the best kind. Thank you.~
@697  = ~I always thought that I looked best by candlelight, with soft music wafting up from the courtyard.~
@698  = ~Are you making advances toward me?~
@699  = ~Nay, my sight is good enough to see that you are fair. The softness of moonlight and starlight merely accents your beauty.~
@700  = ~I must speak as I find. You have the bloom of youth, but I do not think your features will become less pleasant with the passage of time.~
@701  = ~In such a setting, your beauty would be overwhelming.~
@702  = ~Nay, I merely speak as I find.~
@703  = ~I trust that you do not find my remarks impertinent. One sees little beauty in this life, and finding it, I am compelled to praise it.~
@704  = ~There aren't too many people that would describe me as beautiful.~
@705  = ~I don't think it's impertinent, I think it's sweet.~
@706  = ~My lover appreciates my beauty, too.~
@707  = ~Your boldness offends me, Keldorn. I do not appreciate this kind of attention from you.~
@708  = ~If others do not see it, the lack is in them, not in you.~
@709  = ~I find that hard to believe, but if others do not see it, the lack is in them, not in you.~
@710  = ~I am pleased that you take the compliment in the spirit it was intended.~
@711  = ~If you feel the urge to express appreciation for any of my other qualities, please don't hold back!~
@712  = ~You are handsome yourself, in a rugged way.~
@713  = ~I appreciate the sentiment, Keldorn, but I have to ask. You see me every day. Why are you saying this now?~
@714  = ~Such praise coming from someone as enticing as yourself is especially welcome. I've seen few men who can compare to you.~
@715  = ~I accept the compliment, but I don't want you getting any ideas. We're just friends.~
@716  = ~Forgive me, I did not wish to cause offense.~
@717  = ~I shall keep that in mind, my friend.~
@718  = ~You flatter me, my friend, but I know the face that looks back from my mirror well enough.~
@719  = ~Your face has not changed, but I was unable to appreciate it.~
@720  = ~Aye, of course.~
@721  = ~Let us make the most of this favorable light and resume your quest.~
@722  = ~<CHARNAME>, please! Such flatteries are too much. I know the face that looks back from my mirror, and I deserve no such praise.~
@723  = ~Come, let us resume your quest before we are done in by our own gallantry.~
@724  = ~You were raised by your foster-father, Gorion, I believe.~
@725  = ~Aye, and by half the monks of Candlekeep, when Gorion was busy poring over his scrolls.~
@726  = ~Gorion was a good man, and a fair one. You would have liked him.~
@727  = ~Where did you hear about that?~
@728  = ~I don't really like talking about it.~
@729  = ~Your presence in that learned community must have been like the first spring day after a long winter.~
@730  = ~I can imagine our meeting. Two old men talking about yesteryear among moldering tomes.~
@731  = ~I didn't mean it like that!~
@732  = ~His yesteryears went back a lot further than yours. You're probably closer to my age than to his.~
@733  = ~Gorion's interest was not confined to the past. He and I shared many lively discussions about all kinds of things.~
@734  = ~Heh. You could have regaled each other with tales of the days before Netheril fell.~
@735  = ~He would have appreciated the chance to talk to a contemporary. I was a bit much for him, sometimes.~
@736  = ~Perhaps I heard you mention it to one of our other companions. Would you rather not talk about it?~
@737  = ~No, it's alright. Some of my best times were in that library, chatting with the monks and scholars.~
@738  = ~I don't mind. Gorion was a good man, and a fair one. You would have liked him.~
@739  = ~It's still too painful to talk about, even after all this time.~
@740  = ~I don't ever want to talk about it again. It was the dullest time of my life, surrounded by nothing but old men.~
@741  = ~Is it still a painful memory?~
@742  = ~I just miss Gorion. He was a good man, and a fair one. You would have liked him.~
@743  = ~Yes, even after all this time.~
@744  = ~I can imagine how they must have fussed over you. One child with a dozen grandfathers.~
@745  = ~They fussed a bit, especially when I was small, but some of them became quite good friends.~
@746  = ~That may explain why I've always been more comfortable with people who are older than me than I am with people my own age.~
@747  = ~They fretted like so many mother hens. If you went there now, they would probably take you by the ear and warn you to keep your mind on your studies and stay away from the girls.~
@748  = ~I didn't look at all of them as grandfathers. I always had trouble concentrating when Brother Parda was teaching. The way he smiled...~
@749  = ~Oh?~
@750  = ~I just can't bring myself to think of you as old.~
@751  = ~It wouldn't have been stuffy, that's for sure. Gorion was as much a friend as he was a mentor. We talked about everything.~
@752  = ~He probably would have tried to act paternal with you, too. I can see him telling you to keep your mind on your studies and stay away from the girls.~
@753  = ~Oh, no! Books are too modern an invention for that conversation. He would have taken you to the tunnels beneath the library, shown you the cave paintings, and asked if you remembered the artist!~
@754  = ~Interesting. I am amazed that you and he were able to connect at all, given the difference in your ages.~
@755  = ~The difference meant nothing. Our relationship was based on affection, not on any similarity or dissimilarity in age.~
@756  = ~He was patient, Keldorn. He took my youth and inexperience into account, but the most important part was that he was willing to communicate.~
@757  = ~He didn't understand everything I said, and I didn't understand everything he said, but we cared about each other. That made everything alright.~
@758  = ~We argued a lot, to tell you the truth. He loved me like a daughter, I'm sure of it, but I don't think he ever really understood me.~
@759  = ~It worked because he was like a father to me. It wasn't like I wanted to marry him or anything.~
@760  = ~I'm glad to hear that you had such a good relationship with him, though it is a bit surprising, given the difference in your ages.~
@761  = ~You're teasing me!~
@762  = ~I couldn't help it. You're always saying how ancient you are, but the truth is that you don't seem that way to me.~
@763  = ~You're the one who's always saying how old and decrepit you are. I was just giving you a taste of your own medicine.~
@764  = ~I'm just pointing out the obvious.~
@765  = ~What? You mean that isn't what you fossils do when you get together?~
@766  = ~Then I won't mention it again.~
@767  = ~You and I seem to converse readily enough.~
@768  = ~You aren't an old man.~
@769  = ~Things are different now. A few years, or even a decade or two, don't seem to matter as much as they once did.~
@770  = ~You may have more experience with life than I do, but you don't treat me like a child.~
@771  = ~It gets boring sometimes, but what can I do? You're a member of this party, too.~
@772  = ~You did not find the difference in your ages an obstacle to communication?~
@773  = ~The difference meant nothing. My relationship with the monks was based on affection, not on any similarity or dissimilarity in age.~
@774  = ~They were patient, Keldorn. They took my youth and inexperience into account, but the most important part was that they were willing to communicate.~
@775  = ~They didn't understand everything I said, and I didn't understand everything they said, but we cared about each other. That made everything alright.~
@776  = ~We argued a lot, to tell you the truth. They all treated me like their favorite niece, but I don't think they ever really understood me.~
@777  = ~It worked because they were like a bunch of uncles to me. It wasn't like I wanted to marry any of them or anything.~
@778  = ~Interesting.~
@779  = ~That would have been amusing. We would have been contemporaries.~
@780  = ~Nonsense! You aren't that old.~
@781  = ~You aren't like that, though. You don't treat me like a child.~
@782  = ~You have a youthful attitude.~
@783  = ~Maybe.~
@784  = ~You were infatuated with your tutor?~
@785  = ~I've always found older men attractive.~
@786  = ~If you had seen him with his robe kilted up, you would have been infatuated with him, too.~
@787  = ~He was a lot younger than the other tutors, only a few years older than me. I don't think he ever found out how I lusted after him.~
@788  = ~It went a bit further than that.~
@789  = ~Ew! Gods, no! He was repulsive. Most of the others were kindly old men, but Brother Parda was... sick. It just isn't right for men as old as he was to be interested in young women like that.~
@790  = ~There are days when I feel old.~
@791  = ~Not in the Candlekeep library, you wouldn't.~
@792  = ~You're in the prime of your life. You may have a few gray hairs, but you are fit, you are healthy, and, if I may say this without causing offense, you are attractive.~
@793  = ~You have abused your body, Keldorn. Years of sleeping out in the elements, going days at a time without regular meals, and marching with half-healed injuries will make you feel like that at any age.~
@794  = ~There are days when *I* feel old.~
@795  = ~Ahem. I understand his point of view.~
@796  = ~It sounds like you had an excellent relationship.~
@797  = ~There are some differences that cannot be overcome.~
@798  = ~No, that would be most unnatural.~
@799  = ~Ha! You have made your point. I cannot promise that I will purge the word from my vocabulary, but I will make the attempt.~
@800  = ~Perhaps the difference in our apparent ages is more pronounced than I thought.~
@801  = ~You wound me, but your point is made.~
@802  = ~You are growing up, my friend. Perhaps the difference becomes less pronounced over time.~
@803  = ~You are not a child. You are a vibrant young woman... and perhaps we should rejoin the others.~
@804  = ~I appreciate your forbearance.~
@805  = ~Ahem. Indeed.~
@806  = ~Ahem. I see.~
@807  = ~No indeed, it was not. I am sorry that your past contains such horrors.~
@808  = ~Be that as it may, we have talked long enough. We should return to your quest.~
@809  = ~Your flatteries are enough to make an old paladin blush, but I am grateful for your kindness.~
@810  = ~Perhaps you are right.~
@811  = ~I wanted to thank you, <CHARNAME>. You have been a good friend to me, and I am grateful.~
@812  = ~So... how grateful are you, exactly?~
@813  = ~We're there for each other, Keldorn. You've been a good friend to me, too.~
@814  = ~You act like you've never had a friend before!~
@815  = ~After all this time, we're still 'just friends?'~
@816  = ~(sigh) Here we go again.~
@817  = ~Ha! I recognize that tone. Is there something I can do for you?~
@818  = ~Since you mention it, I would appreciate it if you took my watch, next time we set one.~
@819  = ~No, I don't need you to do anything. I was just wondering why you keep thanking me.~
@820  = ~There's a person I've had my eye on, and I was wondering if you would intercede on my behalf.~
@821  = ~I'm beginning to think that we could be more than just friends.~
@822  = ~You're beginning to alarm me, Keldorn. It seems like you hang on my every word.~
@823  = ~I will endeavor to be there for you, as you have been there for me.~
@824  = ~True friendship is a rare gift. I might have expected such loyalty from another of my Order, but finding it here is a most pleasant surprise.~
@825  = ~Technically, I'm in the Order, too.~
@826  = ~There are honorable people who aren't paladins, Keldorn.~
@827  = ~Must it always come down to a question of loyalty?~
@828  = ~You can count on me, Keldorn, just as I have come to rely on you.~
@829  = ~Er... right.~
@830  = ~All relationships are built on friendship and mutual trust. I am honored that you have chosen to bestow yours on me.~
@831  = ~Is something amiss?~
@832  = ~No, but I feel like we've done this before.~
@833  = ~I'm sorry. I was a bit distracted.~
@834  = ~Nothing is wrong. I'm glad we've become closer, too.~
@835  = ~We aren't very good friends at all, Keldorn. You ramble on and I nod my head every once in a while in the hopes that it will make you shut up.~
@836  = ~If you like.~
@837  = ~That would be... awkward.~
@838  = ~You are something of an oddity, my friend.~
@839  = ~Aye, you are, and the Order is richer for your presence in it.~
@840  = ~So I am beginning to find, much to my delight.~
@841  = ~Mutual affection and respect are two of the three pillars that hold up the dome of friendship. Loyalty is the third.~
@842  = ~I am pleased.~
@843  = ~Perhaps we have. If so, I was inspired to repeat myself.~
@844  = ~Never mind.~
@845  = ~I apologize if I have become tiresome. I will trouble you no more.~
@846  = ~There is a question I would ask of you, my friend. What do you know of Torm?~
@847  = ~He is your patron, is he not?~
@848  = ~He is the god of duty.~
@849  = ~He is the god of paladins, if I'm not mistaken.~
@850  = ~He never allows his paladins to have any fun.~
@851  = ~I know practically nothing about him, I'm afraid.~
@852  = ~I know more than I ever wanted to know about him and all those who serve him.~
@853  = ~Aye, Torm has been my master and my guide since I was old enough to speak his name.~
@854  = ~Aye, and of obedience and truth as well. He has been my master and my guide since I was old enough to speak his name.~
@855  = ~Aye, and of duty, obedience, and truth as well, though it is unlikely that you need me to tell you that.~
@856  = ~That is untrue. His servants are by no means prohibited from seeking enjoyment, although we are required to do so within the bounds of our faith.~
@857  = ~Torm is the god of duty, obedience, and truth. He resides with the other two members of the House of the Triad, Tyr and Ilmater, on Mount Celestia. During the Time of Troubles, he slew Bane, the god of tyranny, though Bane's essence survived, unfortunately. He and his followers were entrusted with keeping one of the Tablets of Fate safe during the Godswar.~
@858  = ~Torm is the servant of Tyr, the god of justice. His servants include faithful warriors, trustworthy guardians, and all those who face danger in the fight against evil.~
@859  = ~I see.~
@860  = ~As Torm's servant, I am sure you understand how important the faithful execution of one's duty is to me, and I would hear your thoughts on the subject.~
@861  = ~Will you be angry with me if I don't always agree with you?~
@862  = ~Left to my own devices, I would not attach as much value to it as you do, but I respect your beliefs.~
@863  = ~I believe as strongly as you do in the importance of fulfilling one's obligations.~
@864  = ~Be practical, Keldorn. It isn't always possible to do everything you say you're going to do, and attempting it will only drive you mad.~
@865  = ~If you want to bind yourself with the chains of your own self-righteousness, fine, but don't drag me into it.~
@866  = ~I would be pleased if you did share my views, but I am your companion, not your master.~
@867  = ~I just wondered. I do believe as you do, but I wanted to find out what your expectations were before I replied.~
@868  = ~I do try, but sometimes, situations change and I'm forced to revise my plans.~
@869  = ~We're all mercenaries, Keldorn, even you. It would be foolish to bind oneself resolutely to a promise when one's employer might renegotiate the contract.~
@870  = ~In that case, I have to disagree with you. I'll do what I want when I want, and spare yourself the head-wagging because I don't care.~
@871  = ~That is not the unreserved agreement I had hoped for, but I can understand why you might resist absolute obedience. I can foresee instances where we might be forced to reconsider our oaths if we are asked to do something dishonorable.~
@872  = ~Your affirmations reassure me that we will not come to grief on the path you have chosen.~
@873  = ~We appear to have reached a significant divergence of opinion, and I find that I cannot agree with your point of view. How do you propose that we resolve our differences?~
@874  = ~I don't anticipate a problem. The only reason I would even consider backing out of a promise is if I could not follow it without violating my morals. Under those circumstances, I would expect you to do the same.~
@875  = ~I try to do the right thing, but our employers often don't. I can't promise that I'll always agree with you, but I will promise that I'll always try to do the right thing.~
@876  = ~We take it one day at a time. I don't tell you how to live your life; you don't tell me how to live mine.~
@877  = ~You shut the hells up and do what I tell you to do. You speak of obedience, but you forget who calls the shots.~
@878  = ~I see that our differences are irreconcilable. I pray that our disagreement will not cause us to come to grief, but I can promise nothing.~
@879  = ~That is prudent, perhaps. In your place, I would do the same.~
@880  = ~I am glad we had this opportunity to clear the air.~
@881  = ~Any time, Keldorn.~
@882  = ~You do realize that it isn't necessary for us to agree on every subject, I hope.~
@883  = ~Let's get back to what we were doing, shall we?~
@884  = ~While we're getting things out in the open, I should probably tell you that while I agree with you on many points, I don't appreciate the attention you pay me.~
@885  = ~I am grateful to have a companion with whom I can enjoy such unguarded conversation.~
@886  = ~Aye, though I trust that we agree on essentials.~
@887  = ~As you wish.~
@888  = ~I shall amend my ways.~
@889  = ~And what is our agenda for today?~
@890  = ~We're going to try to save the world, just like we did yesterday.~
@891  = ~We have a full day of running errands, I'm afraid.~
@892  = ~We need a day of rest, so I thought we might just relax.~
@893  = ~I want to get some shopping done.~
@894  = ~I haven't had a night of debauchery in a while, so I thought I might head over to a tavern and see how it goes.~
@895  = ~Ha! The needs of the many, eh, my friend?~
@896  = ~Aye, we are often in the service of others.~
@897  = ~Perhaps we do need rest to regain our strength. Others require our aid, but we cannot give it unless we are prepared.~
@898  = ~You plan to spend the day *shopping*?~
@899  = ~We're low on everything, Keldorn. We'll be of no use to the people who need us if we haven't got enough healing potions to see us through the next battle.~
@900  = ~Everyone deserves a little private time every once in a while.~
@901  = ~Since when am I obligated to explain myself to you?~
@902  = ~Did you have something else in mind?~
@903  = ~Debauchery?! That is hardly a worthy use of our time.~
@904  = ~Can't you tell when I'm teasing you, silly?~
@905  = ~We deserve it.~
@906  = ~I seem to recall a certain paladin being rather the worse for drink, not too long ago. It's my turn.~
@907  = ~What's the matter, Keldorn? Haven't you recovered from your last binge?~
@908  = ~I need company, Keldorn. Male company. If you aren't willing to give me what I need, I will have to find someone who will.~
@909  = ~I am pleased to see that you consider the needs of others in making your decisions.~
@910  = ~Always, Keldorn. It's what we do.~
@911  = ~I try, Keldorn. It isn't always easy, but I try.~
@912  = ~We have an important task to perform.~
@913  = ~If we help others, they will help us.~
@914  = ~It's all part of being heroes.~
@915  = ~Even if they don't deserve it, eh, Keldorn?~
@916  = ~Our quest affects more than just our own lives, <CHARNAME>. Others rely on us.~
@917  = ~We'll help them, Keldorn, but if we're going to be of any use to anyone, we need rest.~
@918  = ~They can rely on us tomorrow. Today, we all need rest.~
@919  = ~This from the man who was ready to resign from the Order to be with his family.~
@920  = ~I make the decisions around here, Keldorn, not you.~
@921  = ~Don't lecture me, old man.~
@922  = ~That certainly puts me in my place.~
@923  = ~We should continue your quest. Others rely on us.~
@924  = ~We'll help them, Keldorn, but if we're going to be of any use to anyone, we need supplies.~
@925  = ~We need to stock up on a few things, but the truth is that we're exhausted. Reprovisioning ourselves will give us a chance to rest up a bit.~
@926  = ~I don't remember you being such a stickler for keeping to a schedule. You were ready to resign from the Order completely just to be with your family.~
@927  = ~The strong protect the weak. That is how it should be.~
@928  = ~Aye, we have an obligation to defend the helpless.~
@929  = ~I suppose you are right. There are times when it isn't easy, though.~
@930  = ~In a perfect world, yes.~
@931  = ~We shouldn't have to. The weak should learn to take care of themselves, but that isn't going to happen any time soon.~
@932  = ~We should be looking after ourselves, not risking our lives for the lazy.~
@933  = ~It is our duty.~
@934  = ~If they are able.~
@935  = ~All people deserve our aid.~
@936  = ~Heh. You're too clever by far, my friend.~
@937  = ~We deserve nothing of the kind.~
@938  = ~A madness was upon me, <CHARNAME>. I should never have indulged so shamefully. I would hope that you would not make the same mistake.~
@939  = ~Do not allow such trivial desires to cloud your judgment.~
@940  = ~I have... had an obligation to my family as well as to the Order. Once my family's needs were met, I would have returned. Such considerations are behind me now.~
@941  = ~I waste my breath, talking to you.~
@942  = ~I am pleased to see that you believe as I do.~
@943  = ~No one ever said it would be easy, my friend, but we must continue as long as we have strength in our bodies.~
@944  = ~If the world is imperfect, we must do all we can to correct that.~
@945  = ~No it is not, but you are wrong to blame the helpless for their inability to defend themselves. They would if they could. Since they cannot, our task is before us.~
@946  = ~You are not worthy of the regard I held for you. Speak to me no more.~
@947  = ~I begin to wonder if there is such a thing as a truly just society.~
@948  = ~It's an ideal, Keldorn, a hypothetical paradise.~
@949  = ~As long as people continue to seek more than they have a right to have, no.~
@950  = ~I hear Waterdeep is nice.~
@951  = ~Athkatla isn't that bad.~
@952  = ~Now, why would you want that?~
@953  = ~I fear that you may be right.~
@954  = ~Waterdeep may be the closest to the ideal in all of Faerun, but even the City of Splendors has its problems. There is crime and poverty in Waterdeep, as there is everywhere else.~
@955  = ~Much as I love my one-time home, it has its faults. Mages are persecuted while criminals roam free.~
@956  = ~Is it not obvious? I am a paladin of Torm. We strive to rid the world of chaos and injustice as faithfully as we fight to defeat evil. Do you not think this is a worthy goal?~
@957  = ~Sorry, Keldorn. I guess my attempt at sarcasm didn't work all that well.~
@958  = ~It is, but if such a thing came to pass, there would be no place in it for you. A perfect society would need no paladins.~
@959  = ~I try to do the right thing, but a part of me can't help looking for the loopholes.~
@960  = ~In my line of work, I need a bit of moral flexibility.~
@961  = ~No, I don't want that at all! I'd be bored.~
@962  = ~So, if a society were truly moral and just, what would it look like?~
@963  = ~Clean streets, no crime, and everyone would have shelter and food enough to fill their bellies.~
@964  = ~It would be impossible to completely eradicate crime, but wrong-doers would be caught, and their punishments would suit both their deeds and the reason for them.~
@965  = ~It would need to have big marble pillars and fountains of mead. Since we're talking about the home of the gods, it might as well be impressive.~
@966  = ~I'm in no mood for games, Keldorn. Your dream is nigh impossible. Let it go.~
@967  = ~Our roles would change, but we would be needed still.~
@968  = ~Resist, my friend. You can overcome the urgings of your blood toward evil and lawlessness.~
@969  = ~I should have known better than to trust that whatever goodness resides in you would utterly quench the evil of your taint.~
@970  = ~That is a perfect society, but it might not be a just one. It is enough that the law should be upheld, and that all are held accountable for their actions. Those who commit wrong would be dealt with fairly, with attention to mercy as well as justice.~
@971  = ~I could not have said it better myself.~
@972  = ~Nay, I speak of nothing so impossible. In a just society, the law would be upheld, and all would be accountable for their actions. Wrongdoers would be dealt with fairly, with attention to mercy as well as justice.~
@973  = ~I will not let it go, though I will speak of it no more.~
@974  = ~How might such a thing be accomplished, do you think?~
@975  = ~It's your dream. You tell me.~
@976  = ~People have to want it. Educate them, teach them that something like that is possible, and they will seek it themselves.~
@977  = ~Overthrow the current regime and set up government that will adhere to the standards you think are important.~
@978  = ~Wish on a star. It is no less likely to come true than anything else.~
@979  = ~I just don't know.~
@980  = ~I do not know the answer. The Order believes that by helping people overcome tyranny, they will eventually learn to govern themselves better, but progress is slow.~
@981  = ~That is the Order's opinion, as well. It may ultimately be successful, but progress is slow.~
@982  = ~Violence is not the answer. I am certain of that.~
@983  = ~I should like a more concrete plan, but I can think of little enough that would help.~
@984  = ~Neither do I, <CHARNAME>, neither do I.~
@985  = ~Lead on, my friend. You have given me much to think on as we walk.~
@986  = ~Have I told you anything about Esmeltaran?~
@987  = ~We talked about it a little when you told me of the holiday you planned with your family.~
@988  = ~Feeling nostalgic?~
@989  = ~Yes, but I'd like to hear you describe it in more detail.~
@990  = ~You aren't going to get weepy on me, I hope.~
@991  = ~So, I told you nothing at all of the city itself, nor of beautiful Lake Esmel?~
@992  = ~If I am, I am only enjoying memories of a time before any of this started. I was thinking of my childhood there.~
@993  = ~Esmeltaran sits on the northwestern shore of Lake Esmel in eastern Amn, as you know. The hot springs that feed the lake keep it warm all year. I never saw snow until I came to Athkatla.~
@994  = ~The city is arranged like many other Amnian cities, into Wards, but much of the population lives on the estates that surround Lake Esmel.~
@995  = ~Does your family have an estate there?~
@996  = ~That's right. You did say that the city has turned into a resort for the wealthy.~
@997  = ~What occupations do people have?~
@998  = ~I've heard enough about Esmeltaran.~
@999  = ~Nay, I was only thinking of my childhood there.~
@1000 = ~In that case, go on.~
@1001 = ~No offense, but it isn't really a subject that interests me.~
@1002 = ~Still, I'd rather not risk any more long-winded, mournful tales of love lost. They're so tiresome.~
@1003 = ~Aye, though I have little need of it. My mother lives there now. She claims that the sun and warm water help her rheumatism. Eventually, it will pass to my daughters, along with my Athkatla property. Never mind that, though.~
@1004 = ~The lake-shore estates are splendid indeed. Entertainment is an art, with each family trying to outdo each other with lavish evening parties. The conspicuous display of wealth is an Amnian tradition, and it is practiced on the shores of Lake Esmel as readily as it is practiced in Athkatla.~
@1005 = ~As a boy, I cared about none of those things. My passion was swimming, or fishing from the little boats we launched onto the lake.~
@1006 = ~The water was so clear, you could see the fish below the boat, even though the water was deep.~
@1007 = ~It sounds beautiful.~
@1008 = ~You make it sound like you were an ordinary child, not the scion of a wealthy house.~
@1009 = ~So, you were at home in the water, eh? Do you have a swimmer's build underneath all that armor?~
@1010 = ~Thank you for telling me about Esmeltaran, but that's probably enough for now.~
@1011 = ~Most people practice the same trades they do elsewhere. Esmeltaran has wealthy families aplenty, but they will still need candles and barrels, and all the other things that keep a household running smoothly.~
@1012 = ~Then let us continue as we were before.~
@1013 = ~Thank you for listening to the fond recollections of an old man.~
@1014 = ~I shall not trouble you with them again.~
@1015 = ~It was.~
@1016 = ~As long as there is no lack, children care nothing for wealth. My knees were as scraped and as muddy as any other child's, though when I returned home at the end of the day with dirty clothing and sand in my hair, it was my nurse that scolded me rather than my mother.~
@1017 = ~I have maintained myself as well as I could, but time takes its toll on everyone, my friend.~
@1018 = ~When we were not swimming in the warm waters of Lake Esmel or attempting to ensnare its fish, we would prowl the countryside or crouch beside the road, pretending we were highwaymen.~
@1019 = ~Keldorn! I'm surprised that you would do anything so lawless!~
@1020 = ~Now I know why you speak of the place so fondly. It sounds idyllic.~
@1021 = ~Did you have many friends?~
@1022 = ~Tell me of your loves! You must have had some favorites among the court, even if you were young at the time.~
@1023 = ~Thank you for telling me about your childhood, but that's probably enough for now.~
@1024 = ~We were boys! We thought all there was to it was to leap out and cry 'Stand and deliver!' Not that we ever attempted anything of the sort. It was enough to hide among the hedges and stare at the opulent carriages... and speculate about the wondrous people and goods they carried, of course.~
@1025 = ~It was. I cannot think of a better place to grow up.~
@1026 = ~There were a fair few of us, yes. All of us were local boys, born to privilege, though we cared little enough about such things.~
@1027 = ~Nay, I was too young for thoughts of that kind. I left Esmeltaran long before girls became... interesting.~
@1028 = ~Everything changed when I heard my calling. I felt an unbearable yearning to serve Torm, and I could not ignore it. I took to lingering in the temple and seeking advice from the priests there.~
@1029 = ~They must have interceded with my parents, because it was not long before my family returned to Athkatla and I was squired.~
@1030 = ~Your whole family went with you?~
@1031 = ~Was it frightening, being in such a big city? Athkatla is many times the size of Esmeltaran.~
@1032 = ~Did you enjoy being a squire?~
@1033 = ~Thank you for sharing that with me.~
@1034 = ~Aye, though my parents were my only family. I have no brothers or sisters.~
@1035 = ~Athkatla is much bigger than Esmeltaran, but I saw little of it. My duties as a squire in training kept me in the Temple District for those first few years. By the time I was old enough to accompany the knights or senior squires around the city, I no longer had any fear of the place.~
@1036 = ~Aye, though I had much to learn.~
@1037 = ~Well, we have reached the end of my tale.~
@1038 = ~Are you fond of music?~
@1039 = ~I adore music! Shall I sing for you?~
@1040 = ~I do enjoy it, though my tastes are rather particular.~
@1041 = ~I don't dislike it, but I can be a rather indifferent listener.~
@1042 = ~It irritates me that anyone would waste their time on something so frivolous.~
@1043 = ~I would like that very much. When we halt for the day, I will hold you to your offer.~
@1044 = ~You just wait. I'll have you sighing and ready to fight for my honor by the second refrain.~
@1045 = ~What kind of music do you like?~
@1046 = ~Maybe I could hum a bit as we walk?~
@1047 = ~Does music stir your blood and inspire you to passion?~
@1048 = ~What sort of music do you enjoy?~
@1049 = ~I like a heroic ballad.~
@1050 = ~I like something complex, with intricate harmonies and counterpoint.~
@1051 = ~My tastes are rather simple, I'm afraid. I enjoy country tunes, the kind everyone learns as children.~
@1052 = ~Why, I prefer a sultry love song, of course.~
@1053 = ~Ah, well, each person has different tastes.~
@1054 = ~Is that disapproval I sense in your voice?~
@1055 = ~True. I am much more passionate about art.~
@1056 = ~I would not have thought the subject would interest you.~
@1057 = ~You find music frivolous?~
@1058 = ~It's a distraction.~
@1059 = ~Our quests are too pressing to lounge around strumming lutes and reciting poetry.~
@1060 = ~Does it serve any useful purpose?~
@1061 = ~I might have overstated that a bit. I don't really have an opinion on it.~
@1062 = ~In that case, I will divest myself of my weapons and prepare to be entertained.~
@1063 = ~You don't strike me as a music lover.~
@1064 = ~Do you sing?~
@1065 = ~Are you interested in any of the other arts?~
@1066 = ~If you'd like to be really entertained, you could divest yourself of more than your weapons.~
@1067 = ~When I was young, I received considerable exposure to courtly ballads and dances. These days, most of what I hear is triumphant marches, or tavern songs from the men-at-arms, but I still prefer the stately music of my youth.~
@1068 = ~You don't think those marches or tavern songs have merit?~
@1069 = ~If you wish, though I would prefer to wait until I have leisure to enjoy your singing.~
@1070 = ~Can't you concentrate on two things at once?~
@1071 = ~Music is intended to excite emotion in the listener.~
@1072 = ~Does that mean that songs of love inspire tender feelings in you?~
@1073 = ~Aye, they can be quite inspirational.~
@1074 = ~You find yourself moved by music, then?~
@1075 = ~Our tastes are similar, it seems.~
@1076 = ~There is a certain purity inherent in simple things.~
@1077 = ~If music feeds the soul, you tastes run toward heady fare, it seems.~
@1078 = ~You don't like love songs?~
@1079 = ~Not at all! Musical preference is a personal matter. I had not expected your reply, but I make no judgment based on it.~
@1080 = ~You don't strike me as a music lover either.~
@1081 = ~Now there's a surprise. I thought you passed judgment on everything, often before all the facts are presented.~
@1082 = ~Without some form of expression, the soul withers.~
@1083 = ~You don't strike me as an art lover.~
@1084 = ~What form of art interests you?~
@1085 = ~I did not expect such a poetic response from you.~
@1086 = ~You believe that because I am a warrior, I must have no appreciation for gentler things? Though I claim no great proficiency for myself, some of the most renowned artists of our time would have been as comfortable with a sword in their hands as they would have been with a lute or a paint brush.~
@1087 = ~Still, you don't strike me as an art lover.~
@1088 = ~It has nothing to do with your being a warrior. You just seem too cold and unfeeling to care much about the subject.~
@1089 = ~Music may be an inspiration. Many a wavering heart has been steeled by songs of valor, and many a wounded soul has been soothed by songs of tenderness.~
@1090 = ~Aye, it does indeed.~
@1091 = ~That is a curious response, considering how much we are surrounded by it.~
@1092 = ~You're a paladin. What do you care?~
@1093 = ~It would be more accurate to say that I appreciate the arts.~
@1094 = ~Nay... though perhaps I should say that I do not sing well.~
@1095 = ~I appreciate many of the arts, though I excel at none of them, I'm afraid.~
@1096 = ~You are bold, my friend.~
@1097 = ~They serve their purpose, and a preference for them does not imply a lack of character.~
@1098 = ~I prefer to give each task the attention that is its due. If you were to sing for me, I would rather give your performance my undivided attention. It might prove insightful.~
@1099 = ~I am not devoid of gentle emotions.~
@1100 = ~Aye, I am a person of many flaws. I will take up no more of your time.~
@1101 = ~Every person has depths that are not immediately apparent. I have discovered things about you that I never would have guessed when we met in the sewers beneath the Temple District.~
@1102 = ~You don't have to be so subtle! Just ask, and I'll tell you anything you want to know.~
@1103 = ~And I'm always finding out new things about you. I enjoy having this chance to get to know you better.~
@1104 = ~I'll have to be more careful about what I reveal. Everyone likes a little mystery in their lives, no?~
@1105 = ~There are still some things I'd like to discover about you... like what you keep under all that armor.~
@1106 = ~I appreciate your help in my quest, Keldorn, but you and I already know more than enough about each other. We're just traveling companions.~
@1107 = ~Keldorn! Ew! The last thing I want is you getting anywhere close to my 'depths.'~
@1108 = ~I shall keep that in mind.~
@1109 = ~I am enjoying it as well. You are a remarkable individual, my friend.~
@1110 = ~Ha! Perhaps you are right, at that.~
@1111 = ~The same things as any other, though perhaps more battered than most. The less said about that the better, however. Let us return to the task at hand.~
@1112 = ~Understood.~
@1113 = ~Hold a moment, my friend. It is a fine evening, and the music is pleasant.~
@1114 = ~I'm a little tired.~
@1115 = ~I'll stay up a little longer if you want company.~
@1116 = ~You haven't been drinking, have you?~
@1117 = ~Sorry, Keldorn, but I'm going to bed.~
@1118 = ~I will not detain you long, but our tasks leave so little time for merriment, we should seize the opportunity when it presents itself.~
@1119 = ~I would like that.~
@1120 = ~Nay, though my spirits are light.~
@1121 = ~Perhaps I should retire as well. Sleep well, my friend.~
@1122 = ~Would you honor me with a dance?~
@1123 = ~I would love to!~
@1124 = ~My, you are in a good mood this evening! I would enjoy a dance, but I've never seen you show any interest in it before..~
@1125 = ~You've had a long day. Are you up to it?~
@1126 = ~Thank you, but I cannot accept. My lover does not approve of my dancing with other men.~
@1127 = ~It's kind of you to ask, but I think I should just go to bed.~
@1128 = ~With you?! Are you mad? What if someone I know should see us?~
@1129 = ~I thank you.~
@1130 = ~Ordinarily, I do not, but I feel inspired this evening. It is something in the air, perhaps.~
@1131 = ~There's some life in these old bones, I deem. I shall endeavor not to tread on your toes too badly.~
@1132 = ~Aha. I shall regretfully withdraw my request, then, as I do not wish to cause offense.~
@1133 = ~I had hoped you would not find my company so disagreeable, but I see I was mistaken.~
@1134 = ~If you would give me your arm, my lady, we may take our places with the others.~
@1135 = ~You're being so courtly, Keldorn! I could learn to like this!~
@1136 = ~Lead on!~
@1137 = ~I'm afraid that I'm not very good at dancing.~
@1138 = ~Does Torm even approve of dancing?~
@1139 = ~On second thought, I'm not so sure this is a good idea. Maybe I should just go to bed.~
@1140 = ~A man must observe the proper forms, if he is privileged enough to dance with a beautiful young lady such as yourself.~
@1141 = ~You dance with grace, my lady.~
@1142 = ~I used to dance every chance I got. It wasn't often, but I enjoyed it.~
@1143 = ~You must be wearing armored boots, then, because I know that I've stepped on your feet at least four times so far.~
@1144 = ~You aren't so bad yourself. Did Maria like to dance.~
@1145 = ~Holding you like this is giving rise to some very interesting thoughts.~
@1146 = ~I feel awkward doing this. Are you sure it's alright?~
@1147 = ~I'm sorry, Keldorn, but I just can't finish this set with you. I'm just not comfortable with... things.~
@1148 = ~Nonsense. You lack practice, perhaps, but you are doing very well indeed.~
@1149 = ~Torm leaves the matter to Lliira.~
@1150 = ~Your experience shows.~
@1151 = ~Hush, my friend, let us speak no more of her.~
@1152 = ~Pay them no heed, my friend. The dance brings us close, but I am no threat to you.~
@1153 = ~You are doing very well indeed.~
@1154 = ~Forgive me, my friend. I have no wish to make you uneasy. Perhaps it would be best if we went to our rooms. Sleep well.~
@1155 = ~Is that a fragrance you wear in your hair?~
@1156 = ~Er... yes. It isn't too strong, is it?~
@1157 = ~My hair is clean, but I am wearing no scent.~
@1158 = ~I think I would prefer to leave you guessing.~
@1159 = ~You're smelling my *hair*? Stop, Keldorn, I am really not comfortable with this.~
@1160 = ~Nay, it complements your beauty admirably.~
@1161 = ~Perhaps it is the air of wholesomeness that I find so agreeable.~
@1162 = ~As you wish, my lady. I will say only that whatever it is, it complements your beauty admirably.~
@1163 = ~My intentions toward you are innocent, but I am sorry that my ill-considered words have offended you. I will trouble you no more.~
@1164 = ~Alas, all things must end, and the music draws to its close. Will you allow me to kiss your hand in parting?~
@1165 = ~You don't have to, Keldorn. Dancing with you was nice, but I don't want you to feel obligated.~
@1166 = ~You can kiss anything you like.~
@1167 = ~Would I offend you if I refused?~
@1168 = ~(Keldorn raises your hand and barely touches his lips to it. Releasing your hand, he smiles.)~
@1169 = ~It would be an honor.~
@1170 = ~Nay, my friend.~
@1171 = ~Thank you for the privilege of dancing with you. Sleep well, my friend.~
@1172 = ~I wanted to thank you once again for our dance last night.~
@1173 = ~I enjoyed it, too.~
@1174 = ~You were quite the gentleman, but I can't help but wonder. Do you consider me your lady? You referred to me as that several times.~
@1175 = ~Any time you want to do that again, just let me know.~
@1176 = ~I'm afraid I did not find the experience very agreeable.~
@1177 = ~I feel alive, my friend... more than I have felt for years. I have you to thank for that.~
@1178 = ~I'm glad I could help.~
@1179 = ~You are as entitled to credit as much as me. You let yourself be happy for once, and you feel better today as a result of it.~
@1180 = ~Does this change anything between us?~
@1181 = ~You're taking this very seriously.~
@1182 = ~Your gratitude makes me uncomfortable.~
@1183 = ~You are indeed a lady, gentle and kind toward others, with a nobility of character. If you ask if I have aspirations beyond my station, I do not.~
@1184 = ~I shall.~
@1185 = ~You should have said something. I would have understood. What did you dislike?~
@1186 = ~People stared at us, Keldorn, and I did not appreciate their scrutiny.~
@1187 = ~You said 'my lady' a few times too many. It made me uncomfortable.~
@1188 = ~One dance with you and no one else even wanted to come near me.~
@1189 = ~It made my lover jealous.~
@1190 = ~I felt like something had changed between us.~
@1191 = ~Come, my friend. Let us make the most of the day!~
@1192 = ~There may be truth in what you say. It has been a long time since I have felt this good.~
@1193 = ~If my behavior last night has led you to believe that I desire more than friendship between us, let me reassure you that I do not. Your friendship is one of the most treasured of my life, but I am old enough to be your father. I want nothing more than to find a way to repay your kindness to me.~
@1194 = ~Is it possible that you misunderstood my intentions?~
@1195 = ~Forgive my insensitivity. I was so caught up in the pleasure of the moment that I neglected to consider how you must have felt, cavorting in public with someone so obviously your senior. I shall restrain myself in the future.~
@1196 = ~I am sorry to have ruined your enjoyment of the evening, but I was unaware that I was doing so. Forgive the impertinence of this remark, but young men who would shun a beautiful woman just because she shared one dance with an old friend are not worthy of your regard.~
@1197 = ~Forgive me. I have no wish to cause strife between you and your love.~
@1198 = ~Our discussion about music has excited my curiosity. Do you like to read?~
@1199 = ~I'm more of a writer myself.~
@1200 = ~I enjoy it, yes. You may have noticed that I usually read the books we've found in our travels.~
@1201 = ~Yes, but you probably wouldn't enjoy the books I read. I like poetry and romance, you see.~
@1202 = ~No, I've never been particularly interested in books.~
@1203 = ~Aye, I've noticed the journal you use. Do you write poetry as well?~
@1204 = ~A bit. If you're interested, I'll let you read it sometime.~
@1205 = ~You're full of surprises! I would never have imagined that such things interest you.~
@1206 = ~No, but I have indulged in a little erotic fiction, if you're interested in that.~
@1207 = ~No, I prefer more historical literature.~
@1208 = ~Indeed, I have. Do you read poetry as well?~
@1209 = ~A bit. Are you interested in that?~
@1210 = ~I enjoy poetry a great deal, actually.~
@1211 = ~I've always been fascinated by the imagery of the verse. Once the wordiness of prose is stripped away, the meaning is distilled into its purest symbolism.~
@1212 = ~I'm rather surprised that such things interest you.~
@1213 = ~How do you feel about some of the more erotic elements of it?~
@1214 = ~I can only imagine the kind of poetry that would interest you. You're too insensitive to have any taste.~
@1215 = ~Ah.~
@1216 = ~I admire the ability of the poet to condense emotions into a few metered lines.~
@1217 = ~You never struck me as a romantic.~
@1218 = ~I know what you mean. I appreciate that, too.~
@1219 = ~Do you enjoy the more romantic works, as well?~
@1220 = ~I never really thought about it that much.~
@1221 = ~There is a great deal more to romance than physical attraction or carnal gratification. There is the union of minds, the ability to love another for the qualities that make them unique.~
@1222 = ~But you have to admit, the physical aspects of lovemaking aren't bad.~
@1223 = ~That is true. In the end, the more cerebral aspects of love are the ones that last.~
@1224 = ~Perhaps, but the physical attraction usually comes first.~
@1225 = ~You can dream about your chaste, platonic love if you want, but if the sex isn't plentiful and good, I'm not interested.~
@1226 = ~In that case, I shall be sure to save any histories we come across for you.~
@1227 = ~I am sorry to hear that you have such a low opinion of me.~
@1228 = ~We have something in common, it seems. How do you feel about romantic prose? I read part of one of Maria's novels once, but I was discouraged by its obsession with physical ardor.~
@1229 = ~Perhaps you should. It might prove enlightening.~
@1230 = ~I never said otherwise, but for the love to last, there must be more to it than that.~
@1231 = ~Indeed, my friend, they are the most important part.~
@1232 = ~Sometimes... yes, perhaps you are right.~
@1233 = ~You have grown accustomed to a life of adventure, my friend.~
@1234 = ~Yes, but it suits me. I would be bored if I had to settle in one place for too long.~
@1235 = ~There are times that I miss the simplicity of the life I knew before, but I can do more good this way.~
@1236 = ~It has its compensations, that's for sure. I've become incredibly wealthy, for one thing.~
@1237 = ~I do what I have to do, but if I had my choice, I would settle down and raise a family.~
@1238 = ~I can well understand that sentiment. My calling requires frequent travel, but I have learned to enjoy it.~
@1239 = ~Indeed. People like us were never meant to reside in quiet comfort while others suffer injustice.~
@1240 = ~There are more important things than wealth, <CHARNAME>.~
@1241 = ~Would you be satisfied with such a life, I wonder? You have drunk from the cup of the traveler. Would still wine not seem flat and tasteless after that heady draught?~
@1242 = ~It probably would. Nostalgia paints my past life in glowing colors, but I would probably tire of it soon enough.~
@1243 = ~I want a family, Keldorn, and a husband by my side. Together, we would live the quiet life, and forget the ceaseless wandering we're doing now.~
@1244 = ~Oh, no doubt, but I don't plan to settle down for that long. Just a short break to catch my breath.~
@1245 = ~You make it sound like a bad thing. Isn't that what you want?~
@1246 = ~You may wish to marry, someday. Would you ask your husband to endure the hardship of the road?~
@1247 = ~If I ever marry, my husband would have to love adventuring as much as I do.~
@1248 = ~People depend on me, Keldorn. My obligations will not let me rest. I would like to find a man that shared my sense of duty, but if I don't, I will still do what I have to do.~
@1249 = ~It wouldn't matter anyway. I've pretty much given up on love.~
@1250 = ~My lover and I will work that out when the time comes.~
@1251 = ~No, I'll marry all right, and when I do, I'll settle down.~
@1252 = ~Indeed. A stable home has its attractions, but there are still so many injustices to right that true retirement seems impossible.~
@1253 = ~Your obligations will not end because you want them to. Will you turn your back on all who need you?~
@1254 = ~No, I could never do that, even if it meant more adventuring than I wanted.~
@1255 = ~I will have served my time. If the world still has problems, another person can solve them.~
@1256 = ~This is between my lover and I. We've already worked it out.~
@1257 = ~I would give this all up now, if I didn't have a personal stake in the outcome.~
@1258 = ~If that is what truly what you desire, I hope you get it. I understand the need for rest, but your obligations will not end.~
@1259 = ~I know, and that's why I say that I probably won't be able to retire for long.~
@1260 = ~Don't talk to me about obligations! I'd give this up right now, if I didn't have a personal stake in the outcome.~
@1261 = ~Nay, my friend, I could never stand idle while Torm still has work for me. Nor could you, I deem. Your obligations will not end because you desire it.~
@1262 = ~I hope you find what you seek.~
@1263 = ~Your sense of duty is most becoming, my friend. I wish you every success.~
@1264 = ~You are young. All things are still possible for you.~
@1265 = ~Forgive me. I did not wish to interfere in such a private matter.~
@1266 = ~I see. Perhaps you are not the woman I thought you were.~
@1267 = ~I have been thinking much of late. I have had many friends over the years, but most are no longer a part of my life.~
@1268 = ~I've lost a few friends over the years, too. It hurt at the time, but I survived.~
@1269 = ~I'm sorry to hear that, Keldorn.~
@1270 = ~Your calling demands much of you. Few friendships could withstand that kind of strain.~
@1271 = ~It sounds to me like you aren't making the right kind of friends.~
@1272 = ~Aye, it is an ache I know well, but the partings have not always been sad.~
@1273 = ~The partings have not always been sad.~
@1274 = ~That is true enough, but that has not always been the reason the friendships ended.~
@1275 = ~Nay, there have been few friendships I have regretted.~
@1276 = ~Some people enter our lives through happenstance. A chance meeting and a few words and friendship grows. The tides of their lives push them to another shore, and they are gone. This is no cause for mourning.~
@1277 = ~The seasons change, and friends grow distant.~
@1278 = ~I would still feel angry about their desertion, or at least sad.~
@1279 = ~Yes, it is best to enjoy their company while you can and bid them a fond farewell when the time comes.~
@1280 = ~What would you do if you see them again?~
@1281 = ~You don't need people that fickle in your life, anyway.~
@1282 = ~They have not abandoned me.~
@1283 = ~Aye, that is the best course. If there must be a parting, let it be a friendly one.~
@1284 = ~The currents that took them away may yet bring them back. If that were to happen, I would welcome them as friends that I have missed, with no blame on either side.~
@1285 = ~Not all are fickle, merely absent.~
@1286 = ~Others come into our lives because there is some greater purpose for them to be there. They had some part to play in my life, or I in theirs. When that role is ended, they too drift away, or duty or death calls them elsewhere.~
@1287 = ~I wonder what that says about my friendship with Imoen.~
@1288 = ~Are you saying that Gorion died because his part in my life was over?~
@1289 = ~That sounds like a mercenary view of friendship. People have a job to do, and when it's done, they're gone.~
@1290 = ~What does that say about your relationship with Maria?~
@1291 = ~I don't believe it's fate.~
@1292 = ~Have you ever considered the possibility that your self-righteous, overbearing personality just drives people away?~
@1293 = ~Perhaps it was necessary for you to learn to live without her for a time. Or perhaps she needed to learn to live without you.~
@1294 = ~I am certain there were larger forces at work. Who would claim to understand the will of the gods? But the fact remains that you would never have discovered your own inner strength if Gorion had lived.~
@1295 = ~It may be as you say, or it may be that we are all put on this plane to serve some purpose. I would be a poor servant of Torm indeed if I doubted his presence in my life.~
@1296 = ~Maria was my anchor. No matter where I found myself, I knew that she was home, safe with the children, and a part of me was there, too. Perhaps her presence in my life was holding me back, preventing me from serving Torm to the fullness of my potential.~
@1297 = ~It is odd that I can speak of our marriage with such detachment, but I have reconciled myself with the past. It is the present which concerns me now, and my duty as Torm's servant on Toril.~
@1298 = ~There can be no doubt that the choices we make determine the outcome of our lives, but I cannot help but wonder whether greater forces guide us, even as we think that we act on our own desires.~
@1299 = ~Aye, and your readiness to raise the point affirms my fears.~
@1300 = ~There is another type of friendship, one that has nothing to do with chance or with fate. The friendships that endure all trials and all separations are those where each party completes the whole, where the bond that is formed is stronger than the individuals that forge it.~
@1301 = ~I like the sound of that.~
@1302 = ~You are a romantic, after all.~
@1303 = ~Are you saying what I think you're saying?~
@1304 = ~I'm not sure I like the turn this conversation has taken. This is a conversation you should be having with someone else. Not me.~
@1305 = ~Such a friendship is rare, but it exists, I am certain.~
@1306 = ~Perhaps I am.~
@1307 = ~I do not know.~
@1308 = ~Yes... of course.~
@1309 = ~I have come to the conclusion that everything happens for a reason.~
@1310 = ~For you, maybe. There's plenty of things in my life that I can't explain.~
@1311 = ~Heh. Apart from being the will of the gods?~
@1312 = ~Maybe, but sometimes, it takes a while to figure out what that reason is.~
@1313 = ~Believe what you want, but I still think that sometimes, things just happen for no reason whatsoever.~
@1314 = ~Your life is far more complicated than mine, my friend.~
@1315 = ~The will of the gods is a mysterious thing, but they have reasons for all that they set in motion, even if we are incapable of understanding them at the time.~
@1316 = ~Aye, the reason may become clear in time, though it may be baffling enough at the outset.~
@1317 = ~I cannot accept that. My faith demands another explanation.~
@1318 = ~The events of my recent past, all the trials I have undergone, have tested my faith and sunk me almost to the pits of despair. That is behind me now, but the memory will be slow to fade.~
@1319 = ~I can understand that. I know the unpleasant memories always stay with me longer than the happy ones.~
@1320 = ~I thought you were feeling better. Is the memory still causing you pain?~
@1321 = ~It has made you a stronger person.~
@1322 = ~You're *still* moaning about that? Will it never end?~
@1323 = ~We need the memory of the pain. Without sorrow, happiness has little meaning.~
@1324 = ~I could have done without some of the sadness in my life.~
@1325 = ~I know, Keldorn. There have been times that I wished I could have told you, to give you something to look forward to, but you have to learn that lesson yourself.~
@1326 = ~That's one way of looking at it.~
@1327 = ~Does that mean that you're happy now?~
@1328 = ~Whatever.~
@1329 = ~Aye, perhaps you are right.~
@1330 = ~It is ended now.~
@1331 = ~Your life has held more than your share of heartache. Perhaps in time, it may also contain an equal share of joy.~
@1332 = ~You were right to remain silent. I would not have understood.~
@1333 = ~I am happier now than I have been in a long, long time. I rise each day full of hope, and I give thanks to Torm for delivering me from the darkness.~
@1334 = ~I'm happy for you, Keldorn. It does my heart good to see you healed.~
@1335 = ~Thank Torm, if you will, but the strength to endure was yours.~
@1336 = ~I'm just glad it's over. It took long enough.~
@1337 = ~What is wrong?~
@1338 = ~I'm happy for you, I really am. I guess I just have trouble accepting that because my own life is so troubled.~
@1339 = ~We've been over this ground so many times that we're beginning to wear ruts into it. I'm sick of hearing about it.~
@1340 = ~I didn't want to say it, but the truth is that I'm just not as interested in you or your problems as you seem to want me to be.~
@1341 = ~Thank you, dear friend.~
@1342 = ~Any strength I have, Torm has given me... and your own friendship has helped.~
@1343 = ~I will not trouble you again.~
@1344 = ~If I may ask a trivial question, what is your favorite color?~
@1345 = ~Deep wine red.~
@1346 = ~Vibrant red.~
@1347 = ~Amber, like honey.~
@1348 = ~Orange, like flame.~
@1349 = ~Buttercup yellow.~
@1350 = ~Pale, soft yellow, like honeysuckle or cinquefoil.~
@1351 = ~Pale green, like the first leaves of spring.~
@1352 = ~Deep forest green.~
@1353 = ~Pale blue, like the sky on a cloudless day.~
@1354 = ~True blue, like columbines or Tyr's mantle.~
@1355 = ~Indigo, like the night sky.~
@1356 = ~Deep violet.~
@1357 = ~Pale purple, like lilacs.~
@1358 = ~Pale, soft pink.~
@1359 = ~White, pure and simple.~
@1360 = ~Gray, shadowy and mysterious.~
@1361 = ~Brown, rich and earthy.~
@1362 = ~Sleek black.~
@1363 = ~I don't know if I could narrow it down to one color.~
@1364 = ~It is a rich, heady color, and a noble one. Poets and dreamers use it to evoke an air of sensuous mystery.~
@1365 = ~It is a bold color, to be sure, and well suited to the brave leader you have become.~
@1366 = ~It is a warm, inviting color.~
@1367 = ~It is a vibrant, lively color.~
@1368 = ~It is a cheerful, energetic color.~
@1369 = ~It is a soft, gentle color.~
@1370 = ~It is a fresh, lively color.~
@1371 = ~It is a soothing color, and Ao must have been fond of it, to paint so much of the world with it.~
@1372 = ~It is a fresh, pure shade, and one we see much of.~
@1373 = ~It is a clear, honest color.~
@1374 = ~It is a profound color, subtle and intense at the same time.~
@1375 = ~It is a rich, profound color. It speaks of luxury, but also of introspection.~
@1376 = ~It is a soft, subtle shade, somehow both gentle and elusive.~
@1377 = ~It is a gentle, feminine color, always lovely to behold.~
@1378 = ~Pure it may be, but simple, it is not. It draws they eye and invites closer examination.~
@1379 = ~There is an intensity to the shade, balanced between light and dark.~
@1380 = ~It is a warm, familiar color, but it is a luxurious one, as well.~
@1381 = ~It is an elegant, mysterious color, as well.~
@1382 = ~I see your point. Each has something to recommend it.~
@1383 = ~What factors led to your choice?~
@1384 = ~I don't know. It just kind of appealed to me, I guess. It's hard to say why you like something.~
@1385 = ~Keldorn! What kind of a question is that? You wear blue a great deal, but I bet you don't know why you do.~
@1386 = ~The color looks good on me. I think we prefer colors that suit us, don't you?~
@1387 = ~Er... is it important?~
@1388 = ~Aye, that it is. I must say that the color suits you, however.~
@1389 = ~Very true.~
@1390 = ~The color does suit you remarkably well.~
@1391 = ~Nay, I asked only to satisfy my curiosity.~
@1392 = ~Since we are speaking of your likes and dislikes, what sort of beverage do you prefer?~
@1393 = ~I prefer fine wines, but I don't often get the opportunity to sample them.~
@1394 = ~It depends on my mood. You may have noticed that I don't always order the same thing when we're in a tavern.~
@1395 = ~I'm not too fussy, Keldorn. As long as it quenches my thirst, I'm happy.~
@1396 = ~Why? Have you got a flask of something delicious hidden away somewhere?~
@1397 = ~I shall be on the lookout for some, since you have expressed an interest.~
@1398 = ~I have noticed that, though I never remarked upon it. It would have been strange for me to ask you about your beverage selection.~
@1399 = ~You may adapt well to the lack we so often find while traveling, but I would not call your tastes indiscriminate.~
@1400 = ~Nay, but if I had, I would take great pleasure in sharing it with you.~
@1401 = ~While we are on the subject of taste, that the stew you made the other evening was outstanding. If I may ask, what is your secret?~
@1402 = ~I've always been a good cook, but it was exactly the same thing we had the night before.~
@1403 = ~I blended the rabbit you caught with diced unicorn, bathed it in a sauce of elverquisst and faerie dust, and added a garniture of slivered sapphire and walnut husks.~
@1404 = ~I stir the pot six times widdershins while chanting a Turmish sutra.~
@1405 = ~I cook it. It gets hot. We eat.~
@1406 = ~Whatever you did... er...~
@1407 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, my attention appears to have wandered.~
@1408 = ~You weren't paying attention to a word I said!~
@1409 = ~You seem a little distracted.~
@1410 = ~I'll say! This conversation is the strangest you and I have ever had.~
@1411 = ~I suppose it's only to be expected. Old as you are, you were bound to become senile one of these days.~
@1412 = ~On the contrary, I paid attention to every word... though perhaps not to their meaning.~
@1413 = ~I was paying greater attention to your voice than I was to your replies. Forgive me.~
@1414 = ~You must like hearing it, then, to have kept the conversation going this long.~
@1415 = ~Think nothing of it, Keldorn. We've all been under a great deal of strain, lately.~
@1416 = ~It's rather flattering, actually.~
@1417 = ~Keldorn, please! Next thing I know, you'll be praising my eyes. I can't bear that kind of attention from you.~
@1418 = ~I apologize for my distraction.~
@1419 = ~I apologize. I meant no offense.~
@1420 = ~Ahem. Regardless, I should have been more alert.~
@1421 = ~It is a fine night, my friend, and I would like to look at the stars. Will you walk with me... away from the others?~
@1422 = ~I'd like that. I'm quite fond of star-gazing.~
@1423 = ~Of course. I always enjoy your company.~
@1424 = ~You're not doing this just to hear me talk again, I hope?~
@1425 = ~I shouldn't. My lover might not understand.~
@1426 = ~Keldorn, no. I'm sorry, but after our last conversation, I think I know what you want to say, and I don't want to hear it.~
@1427 = ~As am I...~
@1428 = ~As I enjoy yours...~
@1429 = ~Nay, my friend, I desire only your company...~
@1430 = ~I... I understand.~
@1431 = ~Come, walk with me.~
@1432 = ~The stars are most serene, tonight. Their beauty is breathtaking... as is yours.~
@1433 = ~Do not protest! I will hear none of it. It is you who has taught me to gaze beyond the veil of inconsequential faults, and I behold a world full of wonder.~
@1434 = ~You seem very happy.~
@1435 = ~You act like you've never seen the stars before.~
@1436 = ~Who are you and what have you done with Keldorn?~
@1437 = ~Keldorn, don't. You're making me responsible for your happiness, and I can't live with that burden.~
@1438 = ~I am.~
@1439 = ~I have not. Never like this.~
@1440 = ~I am Keldorn. I have become the man I should always have been.~
@1441 = ~If you want to go back, I understand, but I want you to know that I do not hold you responsible for my wellbeing.~
@1442 = ~Your intensity is too much. I want to go back.~
@1443 = ~My affection for you has grown to the point where I can conceal it no longer. Will you...~
@1444 = ~May I kiss you, <CHARNAME>?~
@1445 = ~Yes.~
@1446 = ~I thought you would never ask.~
@1447 = ~Only if you can show your affection no other way.~
@1448 = ~It would not be right. You know there is another who holds my heart.~
@1449 = ~No. I'm sorry, Keldorn, but I cannot return your feelings.~
@1450 = ~Gods, no! I feel ill even thinking about it!~
@1451 = ~I understand. Please allow me to escort you back to the others.~
@1452 = ~(Keldorn's arms encircle you and he hesitates only a moment before bringing your lips to his. His kiss is chaste, but he trembles with emotion.)~
@1453 = ~Don't hold back, Keldorn. I want this.~
@1454 = ~(You kiss him passionately.)~
@1455 = ~Thank you.~
@1456 = ~Ew! I thought you were going to kiss me on the cheek!~
@1457 = ~I see. I had hoped that you might find it in your heart to return some of the regard this old paladin feels in his, but if you do not, I shall not insist.~
@1458 = ~No, you big lummox! I meant that I'd like a good deal more than a kiss!~
@1459 = ~I didn't want to hurt your feelings.~
@1460 = ~I appreciate that you feel an attraction toward me, but the thought of actually kissing you makes me a bit queasy.~
@1461 = ~Of course. Forgive me. Please allow me to escort you back to the others.~
@1462 = ~I see. I withdraw the request. Come, I will bring you back to the others, assuming that you would not be sickened at the thought of such a wizened escort.~
@1463 = ~Dear, sweet lady, I dare not! The touch of your lips fills my soul with longing, and my veins with fire like the strongest wine. My heart is too full. I can bear no more.~
@1464 = ~Let us return to the others, dearest <CHARNAME>, and when we rest, I shall dream only of the exquisite tenderness of your kiss.~
@1465 = ~Forgive me! My intention was not to inflict myself upon you. It shall not happen again. Please, allow me to escort you back to the others. Perhaps their company will ease the memory of my impropriety.~
@1466 = ~I told myself that I felt only friendship for you. I made myself believe that my feelings for you were appropriate and just. I deceived myself.~
@1467 = ~I can deny my feelings no longer. I love you. I burn for you. This must end.~
@1468 = ~<CHARNAME>, your heart is given to another. It can never be mine. Forgive me.~
@1469 = ~Good morning! I trust you slept well?~
@1470 = ~I would have slept better if you had not ended our evening so abruptly.~
@1471 = ~I slept very well indeed. I am glad that we had the opportunity to talk last night.~
@1472 = ~I slept well enough. What's on your mind?~
@1473 = ~About last night...~
@1474 = ~In some ways, I too wish that duty had not demanded that I stop when I did.~
@1475 = ~As am I.~
@1476 = ~I will treasure the memory for the rest of my life, and carry the sweetness of the moment to the grave. I have something for you. Will you accept this small token of my regard for you? It is not much, but it is the only gift I have to offer.~
@1477 = ~I will treasure it always.~
@1478 = ~It's a ring, Keldorn. Does this mean what I think it means?~
@1479 = ~I couldn't possibly accept. It's too valuable.~
@1480 = ~I appreciate the gesture, but this seems so sudden...~
@1481 = ~The ring was given to me by my mentor after I was knighted. He gave it to me as a remembrance of our time together and as a reminder that wherever my life took me, our friendship would endure.~
@1482 = ~What a thoughtful gift! Thank you, Keldorn!~
@1483 = ~This doesn't make me your squire, does it?~
@1484 = ~I appreciate the gesture, but wouldn't he notice that you aren't wearing it anymore?~
@1485 = ~Were you and he lovers?~
@1486 = ~It is a token of friendship, nothing more.~
@1487 = ~Whatever value it holds is nothing compared to the gift you have already given me.~
@1488 = ~I am glad it pleases you.~
@1489 = ~Nay, the only gift a squire may expect from his mentor is a clout on the back once the sash of knighthood is tied about his waist. This was a token of our friendship.~
@1490 = ~He was slain in battle not two years after he gave me the ring, so I do not think he will miss seeing it on my hand. Even were he living today, I think he would have approved.~
@1491 = ~Nay, not at all. When I was a squire, he was like a father to me. Once I was knighted, he became my brother.~
@1492 = ~Take the ring, and remember Keldorn, an old paladin whose life was changed forever by your friendship.~
@1493 = ~You aren't leaving, are you?~
@1494 = ~After last night, I thought there was something more than friendship between us.~
@1495 = ~But we kissed!~
@1496 = ~I will always remember you.~
@1497 = ~I have nothing to give you in return.~
@1498 = ~Nay, I will remain with you until your quest is done, but a time may come when we are parted.~
@1499 = ~What passed between us last night... How my heart leapt! But I know that it can never be. You have your whole life ahead of you. You deserve a handsome young gallant, not a tired old man.~
@1500 = ~Age means nothing! Your heart must tell you that!~
@1501 = ~I don't want that, Keldorn, I want you!~
@1502 = ~So that's it? You kiss me and then you say that it's over?~
@1503 = ~I understand. Thank you for considering my wellbeing.~
@1504 = ~You sound like you expect some kind of protest, but you'll get none from me. I never thought of you as more than a friend.~
@1505 = ~And I, you.~
@1506 = ~You have given me more than I can ever repay.~
@1507 = ~My heart burns for you, but my sense of duty demands that I place no bonds upon you.~
@1508 = ~And I want you, more than you will ever know, but my sense of duty demands that I place no bonds upon you.~
@1509 = ~I should not have kissed you. I should have said what I wanted to say and escorted you back to camp, but my heart would not be content and my desire would brook no refusal.~
@1510 = ~And thank you for accepting my decision so gracefully.~
@1511 = ~I am relieved to find that you are not disappointed. That would have torn my heart. Accept the gift, then, and know that I shall always treasure your friendship.~
@1512 = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>. I love you, and I want you to be happy. You deserve a man as young and vital as yourself, and it would be a most heinous cruelty to place my own selfish desires between you and the happiness that is your due.~
@1513 = ~I will always be here for you, dearest of friends. I will offer you comfort or encouragement whenever you have need, as you have always done for me.~
@1514 = ~I am sorry if this is less than you desired, but it is my fervent prayer that when you do find love, you will find it with a man who is worthy of you. For this to come to pass, I must step aside.~
@1515 = ~You have shown me the way to find joy in my own life, but now that I have found it, it is mine to uphold.~
