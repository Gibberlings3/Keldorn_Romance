==================================================
I.     Overview
==================================================

This mod introduces a romance for the original BioWare NPC Keldorn. It is compatible with all BGII games: original BGII, BGII:EE, BGT, and EET.

He's loyal. He's brave. He's... single?

Life is an uncertain thing, and changes come when we least expect them.

This mod offers a chance to romance Athkatla's newest... and most reluctant... bachelor. All relationships take work, and this one takes more than most, but the rewards are great, for those patient enough to endure the trials.

This romance is not for everyone. It is certainly not a romance for the hasty. When it begins, Keldorn is grieving after the collapse of his 20-year marriage, and it takes him a long, long time to recover. It deals with mature themes, the real consequences of rejection and recovery, and some players may not want to go through all that, no matter how devoted the would-be love interest becomes in Throne of Bhaal. It is also very, very long, with 35+ talks in Shadows of Amn, though the talks are spaced more closely together to compensate for this.

To begin the Keldorn Romance, you must allow Keldorn and Maria to reconcile. He will only consider himself free if his marriage to Maria is legally ended, and imprisoning Maria will only separate them, not divorce them. Also, Maria's incarceration might present childcare issues that would be impossible to overcome.

The mod also features a quest for all PCs, romanced or not, though that, too, requires a reconcilliation between Keldorn and Maria.


==================================================
II.    Compatibility
==================================================

This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET.
It requires the Throne of Bhaal expansion.

ToB, BGT: If you want to install the tweak "Sensible Entrance Points" from TweakPack (component "Convenience Tweaks and/or Cheats"), you have to install it *before* installing Keldorn Romance. If not, Keldorn will wait at a different place as usual in the Headquarters of the Order of the Radiant Heart if sent at home via (mod added) kickout dialogue (not in the common leasure room but in the prelate's office right behind the wall). This is not a game-breaking thing, but it's good to know if you are searching for him in the Order building.


==================================================
III.   Installation
==================================================

The Keldorn Romance is packaged and installed with WeiDU. If properly 
extracted, you should have a "keldorn_rom" folder and setup-keldorn_rom.exe 
in your game directory. To install, simply double-click setup-keldorn_rom.exe 
and follow the instructions on screen. 

Please run setup-keldorn_rom.exe in your game directory to reinstall 
or uninstall.


==================================================
IV.    Romance Walkthrough
==================================================

***Note: If you played the SoA beta, this part is slightly different

When Keldorn asks to visit his family, go with him.

Go with Keldorn while he confronts Sir William and then return with him when
he goes to speak with Maria afterward. Allow him to remain with Maria or retain 
him in your party, as you prefer.

If you allowed him to remain with Maria, he will return to you five days later. 
If you asked him to remain with your party, a messenger will summon him home five
days later. Keldorn will leave, but he will return the next day.

After that, just let the romance play out. Keldorn can be removed from the party
when necessary, but he must be in the party when you transition to ToB. If he is
not, strange things will probably happen. There is no option to summon "my
lover, Keldorn."

This is really not the romance for multi-romancers. Any committed romance
will kill Keldorn's.

The SoA romance is complete if he gives the PC a ring.

In ToB, wait for his dialogue about the first Pocket Plane challenge. After that, resting should trigger a lovetalk. As of v7, this rest can be anywhere (up to v6 it needed to be in the Pocket Plane).

Note: With version 4, multi romance cheat can be set via console: Other romance detection can be disabled by setting 
Global("B!Kel_MultiRomances","GLOBAL",1).


==================================================
V.     Quest Walkthrough
==================================================

If your PC is female and eligible for romance, the quest will begin 2 days after 
Keldorn rejoins the party. If your PC is ineligible for romance, the quest begins 
once Keldorn and Maria reconcile (they still have to reconcile). 

Quest starts when Keldorn literally bumps into an old acquaintance, Zasheida, in 
the Docks. Follow her to the Sea's Bounty. 

Gain access to her room either by her invitation, by bribing or coercing the 
porter into giving you the key, or by asking the Thumb which room is hers and 
either picking or forcing the lock. 

The journal found in the room will take you to a warehouse in the Slums, where 
the party will find livery. 

The livery will point to the safe house in the Gov't district. Keldorn has to take 
you there. If it's daylight when you find the livery, he'll offer to take you 
immediately, or you can ask him to take you there later via PID. 

At the safe house, there are a variety of ways to distract the butler and get the 
documents you need. 

One day later, Vakola confronts Keldorn in the Slums. 

If you decide to find an artist, you can get a "mug shot." Take the sketch around 
the Slums asking if anyone has seen him. Shopkeepers won't rat him out, but beggars 
will, for 10 gp. If you talk to the landlord at the boarding house, he'll tell you 
to look for Vakola at the Sea's Bounty. 

If you let the matter drop, Vakola will find Keldorn himself 3 days later. 

Either way, you'll wind up in a back alley. 

There are both peaceful and violent endings.
